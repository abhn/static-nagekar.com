										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I turned 30 about a month ago. Weeks before I turned 30, I had already started to internally retrospect my soon-to-be-past decade. What went well, what could be improved of I were to do it again. A decade isn&#8217;t the same as a two week sprint they typically have in software teams. Life isn&#8217;t the same as a startup. Nevertheless, the acquired vocabulary slips in, something I&#8217;m not very proud of.</p>



<p>Anyway, a decade isn&#8217;t a trivial amount of time in any human&#8217;s life. For the average person, it is between 10 and 20 percentage of their whole lives. And 20s are definitely special. Many claim they&#8217;re the best ones of your life. We&#8217;ll see about that, but for now, I want to write about some of the 20s-defining moments of my 20s. Not everything can and should be documented in a silly (and very public) blog post, but I&#8217;ll still make an attempt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Entering 20s &#8211; The would&#8217;ve-been-first-paid-project</h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nagekar.com/2015/12/the-october-dance-with-cool-indians.html" target="_blank">My 20s started with me drowning in stress</a>. I had accepted to work on a project that I knew I didn&#8217;t have the time or the skills to complete. The 3rd of October, 2015 was a blur. I was busy working to finish this website project that I shouldn&#8217;t have accepted to work on, but not only did I accept it and not complete it, it also took me 3-4 whole days to realize that I&#8217;m never going to finish it. It was a mess and I even dragged Rajashree into it.</p>



<p>Zooming out slightly, Adi had freshly vanished from the scene and I was also getting used to university commute without him. The friendships formed in the initial years of college were either strengthening or losing their charm and we were all growing up.</p>



<p>The start of my 20s weren&#8217;t without uncertainties. The confidence that I once had in my technical skills were definitely not very healthy and the realities of the world I lived in were slowly dawning. The &#8220;I&#8217;ll start my own company&#8221; spirit was forgotten and I was busy looking at websites of startups to find a place to fit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Project Lumos</h2>



<p>In the third year of engineering, I was lucky to connect with some college seniors who I collaborated with to start something called&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nagekar.com/2016/07/the-project-lumos-experience.html" target="_blank">Project Lumos</a>. It was a mentoring initiative that aimed to create a community around tech learnings and practical skills building. That project helped me form connections in college, feel what it feels like when someone looks up to you, learn and teach and just be part of something bigger than myself.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Internship in Delhi</h2>



<p>My first&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nagekar.com/2018/12/working-for-startups.html" target="_blank">professional tech endeavor</a>&nbsp;arrived in the summary of 2016. I got a email asking if I’d like to be a summer intern for a government tech startup in Delhi. I got the email on a Friday and I had to make a decision, prepare myself (including mentally) and start working from the office on the following Monday.</p>



<p>I had never travelled that far from home before, neither had I taken a flight. Mom was worried, and given the reputation Delhi had back then, rightly so.</p>



<p>But I showed more courage and took up the offer. The next two months gave me many sweet memories. I could channel all of the passion I had for engineering towards a few projects. I was also doing well socially, a confidence building moment that will help me for years after that.</p>



<p>I remember going on a spontaneous&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nagekar.com/2016/11/a-visit-to-the-taj-mahal.html" target="_blank">trip to visit the Taj Mahal</a>, which became the first instance of many in my long list of spontaneous travel adventures.</p>



<p>I think of going to Delhi as a major milestone in my life. It helped me put my hard and soft skills into perspective, and gave me a lot of confidence. It felt like for the first time in my life, I had an elaborate life experience to actually tell others about.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Brahmatal Trek</h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nagekar.com/2017/02/trip-to-brahmatal-uttarakhand.html" target="_blank">Brahmatal trek</a>&nbsp;was special. Traveling from Mumbai all the way to Uttarakhand, covering thousands of kilometres by various modes of transport with friends was special, and the first of its kind of trip for me.</p>



<p>Brahmatal trek made me realize the importance of a family outside of my family; friends. In the wild, I had to rely on friends, make compromises and enjoy time outside of the world of computers, all relatively novel things for me back then.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First Full-time Job &#8211; Laughguru Time</h2>



<p>I didn’t find a job straight of out college. The companies that came hunting for freshers to join didn’t excite me, and I was left without a job towards the end of college.</p>



<p>Around then, Juneja’s company was looking for a Reactjs developer. I didn’t know React, but I did write Javascript. I decided to interview with them and somehow even landed the job.</p>



<p>Working at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nagekar.com/2018/05/the-laughguru-experience.html" target="_blank">LaughGuru</a>&nbsp;meant I had a big fat salary (or at least it felt like that) that was a lot more than the pocket money my parents gave me, or the stipend I got at my internship. I still remember the day the salary was credited into my bank account. I felt rich.</p>



<p>Working at LaughGuru was pleasant. The people were really nice, work was more or less chill, and the job enabled me to rent an apartment closer to work. This was my first time living separately by myself and taking care of my flat. It taught me how to <a href="https://nagekar.com/2018/02/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make a home out of a shelter</a> and gave me a place to create my very first homelab of sorts.</p>



<p>The LaughGuru adventure only lasted nine months, and so was the end of my living-out phase, but it gave me a taste if what adult life might feel like and I was excited for doing it again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Jagriti Yatra</h2>



<p>When I was in Delhi, Riya told me about&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nagekar.com/2018/01/jagriti-yatra.html" target="_blank">Jagriti Yatra</a>. She had recently been and the description sounded really interest. Spending half a month of a train with some 500 other likeminded young people and discovering india and the problems that one can solve through enterprise.</p>



<p>Soon after joining Laughguru, I prioritized going to JY. I got selected and arranged for off time at my new job. It all worked out.</p>



<p>Jagriti Yatra was special because I didn’t really make use of it. I didn’t talk to enough people, I didn’t take the activities seriously, nor did I live the “yatra spirit” so to speak. Partly it was about being influenced by the wrong set of people, and party just misaligned priorities.</p>



<p>The entire Yatra, while enjoyable, taught me how not to approach a novel experience, and I’m grateful for it. I suppose that learning is just as important as any other.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nagekar.com/2019/01/mumbai-to-berlin.html" target="_blank">Moving to Berlin</a></h2>



<p>Sometime in mid 2018, I was back on the hunt for a new job. As I was applying for jobs in Banglore and Delhi, I was told that I could also apply for jobs abroad. I think it was Juneja who told me that, but I&#8217;m fading in my memory.</p>



<p>Emigrating abroad was something I had stopped thinking of ever since&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nagekar.com/2016/10/why-no-masters-for-now.html" target="_blank">dropping the masters plan</a>. I applied for a few jobs that had “visa sponsorship available” written on their listings, and eventually landed an offer CareerFoundry. I didn’t know it back then, but moving countries would turn out to be one of the more significant turning points of my entire life.</p>



<p>I want to believe I’d have turned out to be a similar person even without moving countries, but it did help speed that process up. As a bonus, I ended up more interesting experiences that I’d have ever dreamt, or is possible to summarise. It is a privilege to move countries, and if you get the slightest chance to do it, do it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">My Longest Employer Yet &#8211; Careerfoundry</h2>



<p>The ticket to my European dreams was funded by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nagekar.com/2022/11/6-lessons-learned-during-my-time-at-careerfoundry.html" target="_blank">CareerFoundry</a>, the company I joined when I first moved to Berlin. I ended up working at CareerFoundry for close to four years, much more than I&#8217;d have anticipated when I had accepted the offer. Partly, it was them offering me a role more catered to my career aspirations, but mostly it was the people and my tribe in Berlin. It was really hard to let go of what felt so comfortable, like a home, away from home. It just happened to be at my employer.</p>



<p>CareerFoundry time taught me many important life lessons. It not only defined me as a person, but also emphasized what my traits. The validation we get for our qualities solidifies them, which is probably why company matters and reinforcement of our behaviors is critical.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dreams Do Come True &#8211; Joining Mozilla</h2>



<p>I joined Mozilla in October 2022. I said I&#8217;d join Mozilla in a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nagekar.com/2014/12/top-reasons-why-you-should-start-using.html" target="_blank">blog post dated 2014</a>. To say it was one of the major dreams of my adult life come true wouldn&#8217;t be an overstatement. One of the first things I did after starting my job was schedule a meeting with Aza Dotzler, someone I saw in Mumbai back in 2015 in IIT Bombay Techfest.</p>



<p>I must admit that the pursuit of the dream was a lot more satisfying than the part of living the dream, as with most things in life, but it is still a defining milestone of my 20s and worth a shoutout in this blogpost.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning music</h2>



<p>People often ask &#8220;what&#8217;s something you wish you had done in your 20s?&#8221;. For me, it was learning a musical instrument. During Covid times, I bought my first musical instrument, a Ukulele. I taught myself how to play basic songs and enjoyed the journey. I later got a western acoustic guitar and taught myself basic chords to play my favorite soundtracks.</p>



<p>It is one of those things where you consciously decide upon a task, a deadline and somehow actually make it. For me, that was learning music. I&#8217;m glad I did.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">As the video game nerds say &#8211; character development</h2>



<p>I want to add the importance 20s had on discovering the kind of person I want to become. 20s, especially the Berlin time, not only helped me figure my preferences and beliefs as a person, but also be able to articulate them clearly.</p>



<p>The journey of self discovery and self awareness is an important one, as without it we’re like a windsock changing direction depending on the gust of culture we’re surrounded by. It is a delicate balance of confidence in one’s beliefs and opinions, and a practice in humility to not take oneself and one’s world view too seriously. I’m nowhere near done, but it is good to have made some progress on this front.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In conclusion</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m 30 years old now. That&#8217;s quite a milestone, perhaps one of the major ones. In a way, nothing&#8217;s changed. I was about this age for sometime now. But in a more semantic way, it is quite different. To imagine how old people who were 30 felt when I was in my teens and early 20s, and to realize now I&#8217;m that is&#8230;something.</p>



<p>It is exciting what the next decade would bring for me personally but also for all of us as a society. I sure hope I have some interesting updates to share in my &#8220;Summary of my 30s blog post&#8221;. Stay tuned for that.</p>



<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

<p>One way to make decisions in life is to imagine yourself having made that decision and think if you&#8217;d like to live in that reality along with the risks that the decision brings. Or would you rather live in the reality of having not made that decision.</p>



<p>I think we humans are fairly bad at gauging the costs associated with indecision. I was raised in a way that I was always aware of the risks associated with doing something, and almost never the risks of not doing something. &#8220;Stick to the defaults, to the basics&#8221; was the mantra in my and many households like mine. Middle class Indian families seldom encourage risk taking, even if that comes at a cost of a mostly mediocre life without much social, economic, geographical or any sort of mobility.</p>



<p>Anyway, I digress.</p>



<p>I love driving. I have driven tens of thousands of kilometers in India, thousands more abroad. Last week, I went to the UK. I had a huge desire to drive there after the work part of my trip had concluded.</p>



<p>But there was a problem. I was scared. I had never been to the UK, never driven in Europe and never rented a car by myself. My heart said yes, but the brain had its fair share of concerns. My brain was trained to seeing the risks in doing something, and sticking to the status quo (which in my case meant taking public transport or staying in London, for example) was easier and comfortable.</p>



<p>I read up online and learned that it isn&#8217;t really necessary to have a car in the UK. Trains work just fine. I like trains too. Problem solved. I don&#8217;t need to face my fears. I told Florian that perhaps trains are the better option, and in a very disapproving tone, he asked me &#8220;but don&#8217;t <em>you</em> want to drive?&#8221;</p>



<p>Sometimes, I get so stuck in the process of rationalizing that I forget what it is that I actually want to do, what my heart is <em>begging</em> me to do. Trains being the logical mode of transport is an irrelevant piece of fact if it is driving that I want to do. That&#8217;s <em>my</em> goal. That&#8217;s the definition of rationality right there, not making my decisions based on someone else&#8217;s metrics of efficiency and logic.</p>



<p>On Thursday, I had to make a decision. I was thirty minutes away from checking out of my hotel, and I didn&#8217;t have a plan for my extended weekend or even a place to stay that evening. As hard as it was to swallow the fear of doing something new, something I actually wanted to do for all my life, I did it. I booked a small hatchback car to be picked up from Heathrow Airport and I booked a place to stay that night in Bath.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1924" height="2560" src="https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-scaled.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2732" srcset="https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-scaled.png 1924w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-225x300.png 225w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-188x250.png 188w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-768x1022.png 768w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1154x1536.png 1154w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1539x2048.png 1539w" sizes="(max-width: 1924px) 100vw, 1924px" /></figure>



<p>After finishing work on Thursday, I reached the car rental pickup place and had the keys in my hands at around 7.15pm. I was tired, scared and mentally drained by all of the thoughts of having to do this, and I was finally doing it. I just had some 80 miles to drive before I could lay in bed and feel the feeling of having done it. Would I like that feeling? I absolutely would. And that was the motivation. I took to the road, blasting Bollywood classics, figuring out the car and the rules of the road all on the fly as I drove miles after miles on west-bound M4.</p>



<p>It worked out. I reached an empty parking lot near my Hotel after 10pm. I parked the car, and went to sleep in my hotel room feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment. &#8220;Look maa, I did it. I f-ing lived my dream!&#8221; I wanted to yell.</p>



<p>The next day I asked Ed if I can visit his mom who lived around an hour away from Bath. It worked out. I drove to Wells, spent few hours there and then drove to Glastonbury. Ed&#8217;s parents and I spoke for hours about what felt like every possible topic on Earth. The drive was lovely, and I felt a sense of pride having found their home without much difficulties.</p>



<p>The next day, I drove off early to make it to Stonehenge. The drive there was probably one of the best of my life. I felt like I&#8217;m riding on Aladdin&#8217;s flying carpet through some beautiful grasslands with twisty roads going up and down, revealing and hiding the landscapes as they do. It was all poetic. I probably could&#8217;ve stopped the car and cried a bit to thank the circumstances that led to that moment, but that&#8217;d have looked weird and I think stopping on UK roads to cry isn&#8217;t allowed either.</p>



<p>Ed&#8217;s mom gave me some recommendations for smaller towns to spend my last evening in the UK and I chose Hungerford, a tiny town with what looked like one main street around which most of commerce was arranged. I spent my evening in an Italian restaurant with a talkative server who herself was a Ukrainian immigrant. That evening was a memorable one, and my randomly found hotel in the randomly found city was very cozy, and had live Beatles music performance in the night.</p>



<p>I knew meeting Ed&#8217;s parents would be a highlight of my trip even before I met them, because it connects people in my life that I love. I also knew if I&#8217;m brave enough to rent the car, the entire trip would become one of the best I&#8217;ve ever lived through precisely because driving is something I love doing. I also (also!) knew I&#8217;d love the no-name small towns much more than the bustling cities, something I learned I really like while traveling in the USA.</p>



<p>I wrote the last paragraph thinking of what I&#8217;d have done if I had decided to pursue the recommendations of the internet, or worse, not decided upon anything and spent the time in London sightseeing. Isn&#8217;t it funny that our heart knows it all? It already tells you what you should do by looking at things from the future. I braved a few decisions and I was rewarded with a lifetime of memories.</p>



<p>If only we&#8217;re brave enough to listen to our hearts more often, who knows what other adventures await us to make our wildest dreams feel meager in comparison.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recently, a friend send me some videos on political commentary by a couple of Indian youtubers. They were from youtubers I was already subscribed to, but hadn&#8217;t watched too many of their videos lately. I did remember watching a lot more of their content a year ago. I was <em>obsessed</em> with their commentary on the topics around elections and political campaign. I thought I&#8217;m becoming more politically aware and gaining a lot of useful knowledge about the system.</p>



<p>Then, after the election, I stopped watching them. No more putting political commentary for every meal I was having at home by myself. It felt familiar to something else. Few years ago, I was obsessed with <a href="https://nagekar.com/2020/12/1500-elo-lichess.html">Chess</a> and chess videos on youtube. I was watching every video that <a href="https://nagekar.com/2020/12/1500-elo-lichess.html">Agadmator</a> would post. It went on for many months until it stopped.</p>



<p>That itself wasn&#8217;t new either. I&#8217;ve had times when I used to get really invested in tech reviewers, automobile reviewers and many others, watching them for comfort. While one can always claim to be gaining knowledge out of them (making them educational in some sense), there are other ways of learning like reading or taking a course, but I didn&#8217;t do any of that. I also didn&#8217;t watch other channels. Just a few particular ones. Why was that?</p>



<p>All of that made me think about parasocial relationships. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Parasocial relationships</h2>



<p>Parasocial relationships are, simply put, what happens when someone obsesses over a celebrity and follow them on different platforms (movies, social media, news etc) leading to the belief that they know the celebrity personally, while the celebrity might not know about this person&#8217;s existence. It is an illusion of some form of intimacy felt only by one side. </p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be a celebrity in 2025. It can be an online influencer, a gamer or just a news reporter. The point is more about the asymmetric nature of the relationship and the misguided perception of having a companionship of some sort where there is none. </p>



<p>Earlier in human evolution, anyone you saw or heard about multiple times every day was likely a friend, neighbor or family member. It was natural to feel like their well being is important to you, and that they care about you just as much as you do about them. With advent of media such as books, newspapers and, importantly, internet social networks like twitter and youtube, it was possible to get a level of exposure to strangers (who often have no idea about our existence) that we get of our family or friends, arguably even more. </p>



<p>The internet has a split opinion on the extent of useful and harmful patterns that emerge out of parasocial relationships. On one hand, they may help people feel less lonely by extending their &#8216;friends circle&#8217; to imaginary / fictional friends and even make some of us more empathetic. But on the other hand, is it okay to indulge in these forms of connections knowing they&#8217;re exploiting a weakness in the human mind? Wouldn&#8217;t that be manipulation on part of the people who then recommend us products to buy or to pay to be able to access their more &#8220;premium content&#8221;? </p>



<p>I&#8217;m uncertain how it affects humanity as a whole. All I know is, it costs me a lot of time without many gains in return. I have a more than healthy social circle that I don&#8217;t need to complement it with parasocial relationships, and the time spent &#8220;maintaining&#8221; these relationships is too big of a price to pay for what my mom would just call wasting time on the internet (very rightly so). </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In closing</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve stopped following youtube channels religiously. I do spend my fair share of time on social media, but generally just like to search for something, and then watch it. I think it is healthier than to become a fan, or something more extreme. I also think it applies tangentially to other aspects of life where we obsess over the person rather than the thing they&#8217;re producing or standing for, like politicians, professors, musicians and so on. This, in my opinion, leads to all sorts of strange things like people voting for the person rather than the policies proposed by the political party they represent. I think we can do better than that. </p>



<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We know that, of course. A week is 7 days, 168-something hours. That&#8217;s understood. That&#8217;s scientific. That&#8217;s accurate. That matches reality measured through machines that speak in 0s and 1s. Insurance companies like it, and so do our employers and the government. It is simple and uniform across time and space.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not what I perceive. My perception isn&#8217;t scientific. It isn&#8217;t uniform from one week to another. It isn&#8217;t even uniform in my experience versus in my memories. </p>



<p>What&#8217;s happening? My parents are in town to visit me. They arrived a couple of weeks ago. One of those weeks I had time off from work, while the other I worked as usual, albeit with my parents&#8217; company at home. That made me think of how differently I perceived the time span of those weeks, and how much more happened during the week when I had time off and we were exploring the city.</p>



<p>Which reminded me of my <a href="https://nagekar.com/2025/03/route-66-and-other-adventures-on-a-2000-mile-usa-road-trip.html">two weeks in the US earlier this year</a>. It wasn&#8217;t many days off, but if I start talking about my time in the USA, I can probably go on for a while. It was just so many adventures I ventured out on, novelties that kept my brain focused and active.</p>



<p>But then ask me about how was my week working this week? Or the month before my parents arrived? Or the first six months this year apart from the brief travels, hangouts with friends and so on. I don&#8217;t remember much. It felt like one of those frequency modulation graphs, where the information squeezes in and loosens out depending on the input signal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="256" height="200" src="https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amfm3-en-de.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-2684"/></figure>



<p>Those loosening of the wave phases feel unspectacular when I&#8217;m living through them. Of course, there&#8217;s always a local maxima worry or errand to make me feel like something&#8217;s happening that deserves my attention. But the local maximas of worries, joys or wonder are so tiny that one day is really not different than the next day. One week not very different from another. I think that&#8217;s how one goes living years and years without having much memories to go back to.</p>



<p>When I think of my time spent in this way, I feel like the average lifetime isn&#8217;t nearly long enough for all that I&#8217;d like to do. It is a scary realization that I&#8217;ve already spent years and years of my cumulative limited lifetime that I don&#8217;t have any memories of. </p>



<p>But then, when I look back on my time in the USA, or with my friends in India, or working on the exciting internship project some <a href="https://nagekar.com/2016/06/sixth-semester-and-then.html">9 years ago in Delhi</a>, I&#8217;m reminded of how much life can be lived in 2 weeks or 2 months&#8217; time. An average lifetime seems totally reasonable to live to the point of exhaustion from the joy of being alive every day of it. Those times felt meaningful when I was living through them, and long when I reflect back on them. The opposite of that is lack of meaning in the now, and very few, if any, memories of the time upon reflecting.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s where I think the myth of the 4000 week life lies. No one prepares us for this reality of relative time dependent on what&#8217;s being done during that time. Does it even make sense to maximize this perception of time spent by doing things that yield better &#8220;Return on memories created&#8221;? Right now, I like to think so. At least that&#8217;s what the last ten or so years have showed me. </p>



<p>I am not able to drive any point home here, and I&#8217;m feeling quite mentally, especially emotionally exhausted today. I&#8217;ll end this article here, rather abruptly. Maybe I&#8217;ll come back to it and give it a nicer closing, or maybe I won&#8217;t.</p>



<p>In any case, thank you for reading.</p>

<p><em>It is 5am and I&#8217;m writing this from the McDonalds at Terminal 1, Frantkfurt Airport. Sleep deprivation might deteriorate the writing quality. If you don&#8217;t notice any difference, what does that say about my writing?</em></p>



<p>Today is 4th of October, 2035. Yesterday, I hosted a little birthday party with some friends with home cooked food and a home baked cake. I think that suffices for the grand 40th birthday. </p>



<p>It feels like yesterday that the year 2025 started, with my friends and I having the frequent discussion about turning 30 this year, the plans for the birthday celebration and how life constantly feels like running from one worry to the other. We ask ourselves, does this end, or is this the constant day in and day out that the adults spoke about?</p>



<p>In 2025, the world felt like it was changing on a daily basis. Life an era with compressed historical events happening everyday. Was it an abnormality? A post pandemic world with inflation, polarization and fascist leaders getting elected into positions of power. Was it  really an abnormality, or were we just paying more attention to the state of affairs in the world for the first time?</p>



<p>It was hard to tell. All we knew was, it was overwhelming and exhausting. The world was falling apart, but some Google Sheet had a comment that I was overdue on, and I also forgot to update the Jira ticket after I addressed the Google Sheet comment. </p>



<p>But it wasn&#8217;t all grim, of course. We were very privileged and we recognized it even back then. There were multiple wars across the world with innocent people, children, dying on a daily basis. But our personal worries were limited to visas, work stuff or family drama. I was even working a good job, making enough money and checking many of my boyhood dream list. I often felt guilty to be living in as much privilege as I did, especially given the general state of affairs. </p>



<p>In 2025, I was hopeful and optimistic. I was less optimistic than I was before, but deep down I still believed that people are generally kind and will choose to behave as such when given a choice. Few are inherently evil and malicious, but these few control the systems of oppression that force humanity to behave in non-humane ways. </p>



<p>Over the next 10 years since 2025, the world has become a kinder place. Part of the reason for this change is the collective realization that our outrage at the state of our world must be directed upwards, towards the systems of oppression and power, and the class of people which controls them. </p>



<p>Our outrage should&#8217;ve never been directed towards people of a different ethnic, religious or national identity as ours. It wasn&#8217;t the poor immigrant working their hectic minimum wage job who stole our dream at buying our own house. It was corporate greed. The people sipping through their plastic straws didn&#8217;t cause the planet to become sick. It was corporate greed. The homeless stayed homeless and the ill couldn&#8217;t get the healthcare they needed while people in power, and systems of oppression that enabled them made weapons of mass destruction and sponsored proxy wars. The single mother stealing diapers at the convenient store was never the problem. The society that failed to provide her some cushion as she raised the very society&#8217;s next generation was.</p>



<p>Personally, I&#8217;m glad I live close to my friends and family now. In 2025, many of my conversations with my friends and family used to be about doing this when we meet, planning trips together, cooking for each other and just generally spending more time in the same physical space. Today, in 2035, it is part of my reality. </p>



<p>I have a career that&#8217;s more aligned with my morals. Thanks to that, I&#8217;m more ambitions today than I was in 2025. I&#8217;m also happy and believe I&#8217;m living a life that&#8217;s not just meaningful to me, but adds value to the lives of the fellow life forms around me. </p>



<p>Life&#8217;s good, and I hope it gets better for me and the ones around me in the decade in front of me. Ten years ago I was 30. Ten years from now I&#8217;ll be 50. Life isn&#8217;t all that long, come to think of it. But if that realization comes around the right time, maybe then it is just long enough.</p>



<p>Thank you for reading! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last month, a friend and I embarked on trip to the USA. The journey to even getting to the point of flying out to the USA was filled with visa hurdles, uncertainties and contingencies.</p>



<p>In around January, the visa worked out and the planning started. Given that we&#8217;re both engineers to a fault, the planning was near perfect with everything having worked out just as planned, with planned room for uncertainty and unplanned adventures.</p>



<p>The trip was incredible. It was my first time in the USA, and I had a long list of other first-time experiences in the trip. More on that some other time. In this article, I wanted to specifically focus on something unique; finding a specific highway and how the rest of the trip revolved around it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The setup</h2>



<p>The trip included a week long stay in Florida driving between Miami, Cape Canaveral, Orlando, Tampa, Key West and then flying to Las Vegas, visiting the Grand Canyon, Joshua Tree and finally LA. </p>



<p>Except for the flight from Miami to Vegas, we planned on driving the rest of the route and staying in different hotels, lodges and airbnbs along the way depending on how the trip fitted. Some experiences were planned, like seeing a rocket launch at Kennedy Space Center, while others were left open, like how we spend the days we have in Arizona and California.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Discovering Route 66</h2>



<p>During the journey, as we were driving from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon, we decided to do something we&#8217;d been doing often during this trip; finding local diners to eat at. The hunt for such a diner led us to a small town called Seligman in the state of Arizona. The diner itself was slightly off of interstate 40 that we were driving along, so we decided to take the slight detour.</p>



<p>We spoke briefly about the highway being called the Route 66 and I immediately started connecting the dots between the name and the road from the Disney Pixar &#8220;Cars&#8221; movie.</p>



<p>And it was indeed the case. The movie was based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_66">Historic Route 66</a> that we were driving on. Recognizing the coolness of the road (albeit not fully) we decided to go the other direction from our diner and drive around a bit. It was almost sunset, so we decided to find a nice stop to witness the sunset from the road. We were treated to one of the prettiest sunsets I&#8217;ve had the privilege of viewing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2062" height="2750" src="https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2561" srcset="https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png 2062w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1-225x300.png 225w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1-187x250.png 187w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1-768x1024.png 768w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1-1152x1536.png 1152w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1-1536x2048.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2062px) 100vw, 2062px" /></figure>



<p>We even &#8220;launched&#8221; our sporty Ford Mustang on the Route 66 to check its performance, but were left underwhelmed for most part. The car itself, in its glossy red, looked very pretty and got compliments on the streets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Route 66</h2>



<p>Dubbed the &#8220;Mother Road&#8221;, &#8220;Main road of the US&#8221; and currently one called the Historic Route 66, the road is probably one of the most popular routes in the US. It is over 100 years old and doesn&#8217;t exist in its full glory today having been replaced at most places by modern Interstate Highways.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="3666" height="2750" src="https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2562" srcset="https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png 3666w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-300x225.png 300w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-250x188.png 250w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-768x576.png 768w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-2048x1536.png 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 3666px) 100vw, 3666px" /></figure>



<p>Regardless, the road has a lot of fandom associated with it. Personally, the fact that the Cars movie mentions it, and the town of Radiator Springs from Cars is loosely based on Seligman among some other towns on this route makes it iconic for me.</p>



<p>After nerding out over the last week on many details about this route, I&#8217;m determined to make a road trip happen covering the entirety of the 3,700-ish kilometers of this route.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Living a night on Route 66</h2>



<p>To make the experience even more special, we decided to find a little town with a little model directly on Route 66 on our way back from the Grand Canyon. We decided to pick a little motel in Kingman, Arizona as a pitstop. The town was industrial but not too big, with nice local diners next to our motel. </p>



<p>Having stopped for a spontaneous game of Golf on the way there meant we didn&#8217;t have much time to explore the town itself, but living on the Route 66 was a bucket list item tick in itself.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Yet another thing coming together</h2>



<p>Route 66, as we learned sitting in the Seligman diner, is massive. It goes all the way from Chicago in the state of Illinois to Santa Monica in LA, California.</p>



<p>Our original plan to make the USA trip happen was to attend a friend&#8217;s wedding. Coincidentally, as it hit us in the diner, the couple came from Chicago and LA, roughly the path of the route 66. It was a eureka moment as we discovered that this makes for such a beautiful story and gift idea.</p>



<p>We picked up some presents from the souvenir shop for the friends and thought of a way of presenting it like the way we discovered this route and the nice connection with the trip&#8217;s goal. It couldn&#8217;t have been more perfect, we thought.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Last day of our trip, Route 66 says goodbye</h2>



<p>A side quest for me during this trip was to visit the Santa Monica beach in LA. I had seen it in video games like GTA, and another video game called Life is Strange features an in-game track called Santa Monica Dream by Angus and Julia Stone. I wanted to see a sunset at the Santa Monica pier and touch the Pacific Ocean for the first time in my life.</p>



<p>When we reached the pier, I saw an interesting sign. It said, &#8220;Route 66 &#8211; End of Trail&#8221;. Fascinated, I asked the friend from US we were with what is that about, and he explained that this used to be the end of the Route 66.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2062" height="2750" src="https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2563" srcset="https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3.png 2062w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3-225x300.png 225w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3-187x250.png 187w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3-768x1024.png 768w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3-1152x1536.png 1152w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3-1536x2048.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2062px) 100vw, 2062px" /></figure>



<p>Incredible! Even on the very last day of my trip, the route was somehow there to bid goodbye. I know it is a mere coincidence, but it did feel much more than that, and I got back to the hotel filled with gratitude for the whole episode with the route.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="3666" height="2750" src="https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2565" srcset="https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png 3666w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-300x225.png 300w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-250x188.png 250w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-768x576.png 768w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://nagekar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-2048x1536.png 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 3666px) 100vw, 3666px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In conclusion</h2>



<p>This USA trip was unique. It exceeded any measure of awesome I&#8217;d have expected it to have. From driving a red convertible sports car through the Arizona deserts and California, watching not one but two Falcon 9 launches in the same evening at Kennedy Space Center, an NBA game, feeding crocodiles and turtles, reaching the southernmost point of continental USA, a great wedding day celebration with friends and countless other memories. I returned home sad that the trip ended, and grateful that I could experience it in the first place. It was a real privilege.</p>

<p>Manasi, Adi and I always spoke about wanting to live in a commune, not more than few minutes away from each other and being able see each other every day. This way, we’d be able to spend a lot of time together, nurturing and deepening our friendship. </p>



<p>While not in its ideal form, I did get to actualize some of our thought experiments when Kunal decided to move to Berlin some three years ago. It meant that I&#8217;ll have someone living within 30 mins distance who I&#8217;ve known for more than a decade.</p>



<p>Over the next two years that he lived in Berlin, I learned a lot about local friendships. Some I anticipated, and others were totally new learnings. Kunal left Berlin for India last year. Last week, I was wondering what changed since he left, and what can I do differently about my friendships to make them feel more like our school friendships.</p>



<p>This article is a reflection of some of those thoughts. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why I think friends from our school friendships hit different</h2>



<p>Whenever I meet someone who I studied with in school or university, we immediately hit off. It somehow seems to matter a lot less that we&#8217;ve not been in touch or haven&#8217;t spoken in years. Time has flown, lives changed, many important life milestones passed without having the other person involved, but all of that somehow doesn&#8217;t seem to matter much. We still meet, laugh, make fun of each other and hang out like there was never a break in the relationship. Why?</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s my take: </p>



<p>First, school and university times are tough. Long commutes, lack of ample cash in pocket, academics, coming of age woes, family drama, insecurities etc meant we suffered through a lot of crap together. At the same time, we also had some wonderful times. We got to experience secure friendships, love and moments of intense joys. Going through diverse, emotionally high times together teaches us a lot about people that a well planned brunch at an uptown restaurant where everyone is talking about safe topics with filters doesn&#8217;t get you.</p>



<p>Secondly, being in the same room for a large part of the day everyday for years helps too. I don&#8217;t find it coincidental that my best friends from school and university life aren&#8217;t people I filtered through consciously like we do on the meetup and dating apps, but just folks who were in the same classroom as me, had the same schedules or lived close by. In other words, I just had a regular exposure to these people with mix of me liking to spend time with them, it being easy to find time to spend with them and then sometimes just not having the option to not spent time with them.</p>



<p>We were just forced to be kind to each other, take care of each other and help each other. Well, we weren&#8217;t, but we&#8217;d still have to see each other the next day, so we might as well. We formed our little communes slowly, and then we stuck with it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Having a local friend</h2>



<p>Having a local friend from school meant that I could reach out to him in the evening and ask if he wants to get dinner. It meant that I could rely on him to be there for all house parties and even help clean up when the guests have left, casual ranting session or just a evening to chill together. </p>



<p>Having a local friend also means there&#8217;s someone who&#8217;s aware of the ins and outs of your current life and can give you critical feedback on things and ask the tough questions. Away from home and parents, it is good to have a person to rely on for pointing out when you&#8217;re being stupid.</p>



<p>Having a friend who I can meet multiple times a week also changed how I perceived the city and passage of time. It establishes a nice social routine and de-stress, have a nice dinner and talk about the week. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can we &#8220;fix&#8221; adult friendships?</h2>



<p>Of course, local friendships are a privilege. In bigger cities, it can be challenging to build longer term friendships due to a multitude of reasons. Some of these reasons are extrinsic, and there&#8217;s not much that we can do about them. But there are steps that can be taken on an individual level to foster secure local friendships that feel like a commune, improve our mental well being and make us feel home.  </p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Being spontaneous</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;ve found that being able to see a friend at a short notice is often a very positive signal of how fast the friendship will grow. Building a deep friendship often requires hours and hours of context sharing and supporting one another through thick and thin, and being able to do it more often is always going to help, especially in the busy adult life.</li>



<li><strong>Being well adjusted</strong> &#8211; As we grow older, we build higher and thicker walls around us. Some of these walls are non-negotiable, but others are just preferences in things or our tastes. Our preferences and tastes can subconsciously exclude people and make them feel distant. Being well adjusted to me means to have a personality that&#8217;s compatible with different kinds of people and situations.</li>



<li><strong>Showing vulnerability &#8211; </strong>As a 30ish year old figuring things out, I think it helps to open up about what we&#8217;re not good at, struggling with, insecure about rather than sticking to safe topics all the time. As a bonus, the early one does that, the sooner they get rid of people who might find something non-negotiable, thus freeing up more time for the people who stick around.</li>



<li><strong>Speaking your mind, losing the filter</strong> &#8211; With the best intentions, we often hide our thoughts and feelings. This often leads to boring and dull conversations that don&#8217;t have any emotions in them, like a corporate presentation. If you&#8217;ve ever come out of a chat not remembering a single thing that was talked about, this is why. Everyone was so busy not saying anything potentially offensive, share anything personal or expose any weakness that nothing got said at all.</li>



<li><strong>Respecting invitations</strong> &#8211; Simple one: If you&#8217;re accepting an invitation, try to actually make it. If you&#8217;re going to be late, let them know. If you can&#8217;t make it, say you&#8217;re sorry and plan the next one yourself.</li>



<li><strong>Committing to people</strong> &#8211; Large cities like Berlin make it very easy to have a busy social life without any real need to connect deeply or invest in anyone in particular. But making local friends that I can see every week requires really committing to people. It means prioritizing meeting them, reaching out proactively and spending quality time with them. It also means finding joy in meeting the same set of people that you already think you know most things about, instead of constantly seeking to meet <em>exciting</em> new people. </li>



<li><strong>Mixing friends</strong> &#8211; Mixing friends from different walks of your life is often nerve wrecking, and understandably, many adults avoid it. I&#8217;ve found that the people who introduced me to their friends sooner stayed my friends for longer. Perhaps that level of security with your existing friendships makes those people great friends in general. Or perhaps because we got along so well from the start that we were destined to stay good friends anyway? I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s a causation, or just a correlation, but I often try to involve new friends with my existing set of friends for this reason.</li>
</ol>



<p>Of course, that&#8217;s all how I think, and how I&#8217;ve come to think after my <a href="https://nagekar.com/2025/01/six-whole-years-in-berlin.html">few years here in Berlin</a>. I stick by these principles and do my part in making building a little commune in the foreign city I&#8217;ve found myself in, building on top of the lessons I&#8217;ve learned after having Kunal live in Berlin for a couple of years.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In closing</h2>



<p>Maybe someday, all of my friends do move to a little town where we all live together, see each other for coffee everyday and support each other in all walks of life. But until then, I&#8217;ll try to keep improving my friendship skills. I&#8217;ll turn 30 this year, and I think this skill is going to be one of the more important ones going forward. </p>

<p>Happy new year!</p>



<p>Time flies. It feels like just a few weeks ago that I arrived in a cold grey Berlin <a href="https://nagekar.com/2019/01/mumbai-to-berlin.html">for the first time</a>, having lost a suitcase. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=days+since+7th+jan+2019">But it was 2,192 days ago</a>.</p>



<p>The day I arrived here wasn&#8217;t my best, and the next few weren&#8217;t much better either. But eventually, things worked out and the city really grew on me. Let me rephrase. Cities don&#8217;t grow on people. It is the people, the experiences and the sense of belonging that makes us feel home. </p>



<p>A year before I moved to Berlin, I was living in Nahur, Mumbai trying to make sense of why one set of walls feel like home while the other just a place to sleep. What makes a home, <a href="https://nagekar.com/2018/02/home.html">home</a>? Fortunately for me, the important lessons learned then were used time and again whenever I wanted to feel homely in this foreign city, in a foreign country. </p>



<p>This week I&#8217;m crowd sourcing some new year resolutions from my close friends inspired by <a href="https://moxie.org/stories/year-of-the-challenge/">Moxie</a>, and trying to shape the year forward to the best of my abilities. It has been a busy week at work, since everyone is back from vacations. That, and catching up with people that I hadn&#8217;t see in sometime means I&#8217;m having a packed week. </p>



<p>But I still wanted to find some time to write this article. It is a way of snapshotting this moment in time. Lots of positive changes over the last couple of weeks including a visit to CCC Congress, Freiburg, reading books like Tuedays with Morrie and The Last Lecture and a lot of introspection. </p>



<p>The books and the introspection gave me a profound realization that the passage of time doesn&#8217;t stop, and it passes fast if we don&#8217;t keep moving, keep growing in life. Not only am I getting older, but so are the people around me. If there&#8217;s something I really want to do, now is a good time. <a href="https://nagekar.com/2021/02/the-best-time-of-your-life-is-right-now.html">I knew this</a>, of course. I just had forgotten it lately.</p>



<p>Thank you for reading! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I spoke about my adventures in Uzbekistan briefly in <a href="https://nagekar.com/2024/09/reise-nach-uzbekistan.html">my previous blog post</a>. Apologies if you couldn&#8217;t read it because it was in German. I spent nearly two weeks with a German group and a German tour guide and couldn&#8217;t not use the opportunity to write my very first blog post in a language that I&#8217;ve spend countless hours learning.</p>



<p>Something that I didn&#8217;t mention in that blog post, mostly as I was trying to keep it brief due to the language, was an interesting encounter that I had in Samarkand towards the beginning of our journey.</p>



<p>In Samarkand, Uzbekistan, as we were heading out of a Quran School, I saw another south asian person walking in the opposite direction. Now, since I had landed in Uzbekistan, I had not seen many south asians despite reading that there are many Indians who go to Tashkent to study medicine. So seeing this guy made me instinctively wave at him and ask if he was a &#8220;Desi&#8221;.</p>



<p>He said yes, he was from India, from Karnataka. Super! I thought. He told me that he&#8217;s on a road trip from Bengaluru in the south of India all the way to London, traveling some 25,000kms and visiting 40 countries along the way. I found it extremely fascinating. </p>



<p>We chatted for another minute or two and exchanged phone numbers. He was supposed to pass through Berlin so I invited him to reach out whenever he passes by so that we could meet. In all honesty, I didn&#8217;t expect him to do so, or for it to work out.</p>



<p>But couple of weeks ago, he reached out saying he&#8217;ll be passing through Berlin and would like to meet up for dinner. After some back and forth, he and his daughter finally made it to Berlin on a fine Saturday evening. I took them to Sarvana Bhavan and we had good south Indian dinner. </p>



<p>After that, we walked all the way to Alexanderplatz, and then headed to Warschauerstr, and then walking back to Ostbahnhof after seeing the East Side Gallery. In the end, we were out there walking until late in the night. In spite of me meeting these people for the first time, we connected very well and had a great time. </p>



<p>The next day, we met again for dinner at the very same restaurant. I told them that I was already feeling a bit sad that they were scheduled to leave the next morning, onward in their journey. I was genuinely sad after having felt a bit invested in their journeys for the past couple of weeks concluding with that dinner at Potsdamer Platz, Berlin.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re still in touch, and I&#8217;ll probably see them again someday in India. I think the whole story was quite fascinating for me. A random wave at a stranger and that led to a meetup in Berlin and perhaps new friends in India. Life is chaotic and random. But sometimes, beautiful patterns come out of the chaos. The trip to Uzbekistan itself was pretty random, and then this extra layer of chance bringing few folks together was just cherry on top. A story that I&#8217;d keep telling people!</p>



<p>Thank you for reading. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I came across the idea of slow living and slow things in life through some videos, and wanted to document some of my own after-thoughts on the matter for future reference.</p>



<p>Here’s a synopsis of the original idea: With technology, a lot of things are sped up. Communicating with a friend or family is an instantaneous act. Airplane travel have made traveling anywhere around the world an at most two day endeavor. Access to most of human knowledge is usually a click or two away. Generating a plausible-sounding article draft on a topic takes a minute (caution: ‘plausible-sounding’ is lifting a lot of weight there).</p>



<p>But should the end goal be to speed up everything in life? Intuitively, we&#8217;d all say no. But then, how do we know when we’re doing something that should be optimized versus something that we&#8217;d always like to do slowly, without the need to speed up or optimize? I suppose one way is to define some of the slow things in life, and be mindful of them.</p>



<p>This article is my attempt at bringing conscious thought to these activities and have a reference to look back to later. In the process, I hope you get some ideas too!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reading a book</h3>



<p>There was a time when I read regularly. It has since then turned into very occasional bursts of motivation when I try to read a book as much as possible, ideally to the end, in one sitting as I know I might not get back to it soon again. There&#8217;s always something else I should be doing rather than taking some time to read a good book. Perhaps I should try <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/">blinkist</a>.</p>



<p>Not only is relying on bursts of motivation significantly more inefficient than just small but consistent steps towards a goal, it is also not very fun. Trying to read fast and get to the end of books has made me not want to read all. It sucked the joy out of immersing myself into a book and swimming in the sea of thoughts created by the author. The same is true of book summarizing services.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to rush through a book, reach the end only to have not understood anything and lost any motivation to re-read it properly again. Worse, I don&#8217;t want to read/listen to a summary of a book, feel like I&#8217;ve gotten everything out of it having missed most of it. Then why ruin the fun by speed-running through the book barely letting anything stick on the wall of my mind.</p>



<p>I feel like this is a big miss, and I should see to it that I don&#8217;t ruin reading completely for the sake of reading faster.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hanging out with a friend</h3>



<p>I live in Berlin. One of the nice things about this city is that I&#8217;m surrounded by very friendly people who I love seeing often. Growing older, I&#8217;ve often found myself scheduling hangouts with friends that feel inadequate or too organized. </p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to see a friend for an hour after which I have the next appointment scheduled. The hangout feels shallow, and like a task when it is scheduled so tight in terms of time or agenda. I know that my favorite hangouts are hangouts without a strict agenda that just flowed into its own unique shape. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also realized that most of the deeper conversations I&#8217;ve had with my friends were in private setting with no time bounds. It takes time for conversations to naturally flow into a deeper state, where people think before responding and have time to express complex feelings and emotions. I really value these conversations as they&#8217;ve done a good deal to shape my thoughts, and for that reason, I&#8217;d like to always find adequate time for my friends. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Time for myself</h3>



<p>I often pack my schedule to the point where I&#8217;m constantly chasing behind the next task on my list, the next person I have committed to meeting or getting on a call with, and so on. Some weeks I hardly have a single evening to myself where it is just me, my home and nothing else. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ve found that empty evenings with no plans are a nice way to recharge, think, play guitar, paint or do anything unplanned. They&#8217;re meditative, and help zoom out and refocus. This time must not be rushed, or spent in worry. This leisure shouldn&#8217;t make me feel guilty. This downtime is important, just as sleep is.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cooking and eating a good meal</h3>



<p>With home office and heavy workload, sometimes I cut corners on my meal quality. I grab a quick snack in the afternoon or just eat something that barely qualifies as food, much less dinner, in the evening. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also noticed how much joy it brings me to take time to cook something nice for myself. I&#8217;m an okay cook, and given an hour of time, I can cook a good meal that I&#8217;m extremely satisfied eating. Whenever I skip on this and order something from outside, I am always reminded of how little time that saved and how significantly less satisfying it felt. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I try to take my time to cook. Even if it eats into my other task time, it is worth it. It must not be rushed, and it isn&#8217;t something worth cutting corners in. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Vacation time</h3>



<p>I get a limited number of days off per year. This creates a compulsion to always have a lot of plans crammed into vacation time. If I take a day off, and I don&#8217;t completely jam pack it with todos, I feel guilty that I didn&#8217;t use my day off well. </p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to feel this way. A day off is a day off, whether it is spent doing some adventures or just relaxed with a nice cup of masala tea and some snacks watching an anime. Sometimes it is okay to go to a new city, visit museums, walk around all day until the legs hurt. Other times, just staying home is golden! Perhaps an off day while in a new city doing nothing but eating and sleeping isn&#8217;t a bad idea either.</p>



<p>I am particularly bad at this, but I&#8217;ll try to remind myself that if I always try to follow a template during my off days as I do during my working days, it kinda defeats the point of the off day. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In conclusion</h3>



<p>Working in tech, and trying to optimize everything we work on, sometimes we can go a bit too much in the other direction with things that should be left untouched. Capitalism hasn&#8217;t help this case either, having convinced us to keep automating and abstracting our life and moving to the next levels and creating more value (whatever that means) as fast as possible.</p>



<p>But some things, especially ones that really matter, shouldn&#8217;t be cursed with the infinite growth and optimization virus of tech world. They are better done slowly.</p>



<p>Thank you for reading! </p>
