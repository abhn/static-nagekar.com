As humans we are inclined to feel that life must have a point. We have plans and aspirations and desires. We want to take constant advantage of all the intoxicating existence we&#8217;ve been endowed with. But what&#8217;s life to a lichen? Yet its impulse to exist, to be, is every bit as strong as ours &#8212; arguably stronger. If I were told that I had to spend decades being a furry growth on a rock in the woods, I believe I would lose the will to go on. Lichens don&#8217;t. Like virtually all living things, they will suffer any hardship, endure any insult, for a moment&#8217;s additional existence. Life, in short, just wants to be. But &#8212; and here&#8217;s an interesting point &#8212; for the most part it doesn&#8217;t want to be much.<\/li>\n<li>To a first approximation, as David Raup likes to say, all species are extinct.<\/li>\n<li>&#8230;but you could have all Bdelloid Rotifer experts in the world to dinner and not have to borrow plates from the neighbors.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;And I suppose that&#8217;s why you value someone who spends forty-two years studying a single species of plants, even if it doesn&#8217;t produce anything terribly new?&#8221; &#8220;Precisely&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>From an evolutionary point of view, sex is really just a reward mechanism to encourage us to pass on our genetic material.<\/li>\n<li>It cannot be said too often: All life is one. That is, and I suspect will forever prove to be, the most profound true statement there is.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n  Thank you for reading!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Listing down some interesting quotes from the book &#8216;A brief history of nearly everything&#8217; by Bill Bryson.
