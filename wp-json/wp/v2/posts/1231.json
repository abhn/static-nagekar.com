It has been, for lack of a better word, an interesting year. Not intending on becoming Abhi News Network, I&#8217;ll spare you from having to read about the events of the past year for the thousandth time. Like many people, I realized my full nerd potential and learned how to live indoors for weeks at a time. I also unlocked a new hobby, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nagekar.com\/2020\/12\/1500-elo-lichess.html\">Chess<\/a>. Some other things like traveling and in-person events definitely took a backseat but can&#8217;t do much about that.<\/p>\r\n<p>This short post is about moving this blog back to WordPress. I say back, but the fact is that this website was never on WordPress. I started this blog on ghost.org back in early 2014, but had to quickly move it away from there in spite of absolutely loving Ghost (mostly because of the $5\/month fees). Next up was Blogger before finally settling on GitHub Pages which, by the way, if you&#8217;re just starting out with blogging and can find your way around git on a terminal, you should give a try. Now, feeling the need for a much more elaborate CMS, I&#8217;ve migrated to WordPress running on <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/lightsail\/projects\/wordpress\/\">AWS Lightsail<\/a>. It does cost money, but this time I can afford it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Before this blog existed, I used to write on WordPress on an older blog. That feels like an eternity ago, which it was in internet time. I used to write about latest smartphones and compare them against each other (nothing that actually needed to be done by hand, now that I think about it; 8mp vs 5mp camera, 1gb vs 2gb ram and so on). I would walk into Samsung stores and try to make &#8216;hands-on&#8217; videos of their latest phones. I can&#8217;t imagine doing that today, mostly because of how much the smartphone industry has expanded since 2012-13. Also because it doesn&#8217;t interest me anymore. <\/p>\r\n<p>With WordPress, I hope to be able to write on the go using nothing more than just a browser. <em>&#8220;On the go&#8221;<\/em> might take some more time to become a normal everyday phrase again, but when that happens, I&#8217;ll be ready with my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nagekar.com\/2020\/04\/thinkpad-x230-in-2020.html\">Thinkpad<\/a> and a backpack. To not need a text editor to write Markdown\/HTML, terminal to commit and push, and to see previews without a developer server would be very liberating. I&#8217;m excited about this future.<\/p>\r\n<p>I&#8217;ll end this article with a nice picture I took today. Hope you enjoy looking at it as much as I did looking at Stitch in my house today.<\/p>\r\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1237\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/stitch-scaled-e1611091985641-1024x993.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/stitch-scaled-e1611091985641-1024x993.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/stitch-scaled-e1611091985641-300x291.jpg 300w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/stitch-scaled-e1611091985641-768x745.jpg 768w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/stitch-scaled-e1611091985641-1536x1490.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/stitch-scaled-e1611091985641.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Thank you for reading!<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy new year all!
