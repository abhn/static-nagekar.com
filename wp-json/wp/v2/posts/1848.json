Just a couple of months really.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious when you&#8217;ll turn or you turned 10k days old, it comes around when we&#8217;re 27 years, 4 months and 16 days old. 20k days is, naturally, when we&#8217;re 54 years and 8 months which feels much more further away than it should. What does that tell us about time?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day itself is pretty ordinary. I&#8217;ll get myself a little cake to celebrate, but I&#8217;d have probably done that in any case. It is raining the whole day today. Not sure what&#8217;s up with that. I wanted to go to Conrad to get a USB-A to USB-B cable, and just window shop, but doesn&#8217;t look like I&#8217;ll be doing that given the weather situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t have much to write about here.
