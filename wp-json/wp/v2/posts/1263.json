The illusion of stability and control we have in our lives is comical. Our mind seems to have mastered the art of separating itself from the world events. We almost know it. It is hard not to if you spend any time on internet social medias or any form of conventional news sources. Unfortunate things happen, lives end or get ruined for reasons so trivial that&#8217;d make you not want to believe it.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, when it comes to our own lives, we&#8217;re fairly certain about our timelines. There&#8217;s career, that promotion, getting a house, getting married and so on. There&#8217;s always the <em>end of life<\/em> to be content with what we have; be grateful. Now&#8217;s the time to be at unrest, to complain and wish for more, to hustle. And not like it is our fault. The society is truly designed to make you feel exactly this way, discontent at every single stage of your life. Get good grades or you&#8217;d not get into a good university, study hard or you&#8217;d not have a good job, work harder or you&#8217;d not get that promotion, don&#8217;t plateau in your career or you&#8217;d not be able to afford a house, keep working to be able to enjoy a happy retirement and so on.<\/p>\n<p>And what if you&#8217;re still not able to enjoy your life finally at 65? <em>Oh those are just the guidelines, too bad it didn&#8217;t work out for you. Guess what, it is called 1% for a reason. Try again in the next one. And of course, thank you for your participation in the rat race.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So, what&#8217;s my point?<\/p>\n<p>The point that I&#8217;m trying to make is that if something is important enough to you, do it without waiting for some special phase of life to come by. No one knows how tomorrow will look like. If this entire pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we have no control over the future, not tomorrow and much less months or years in the future. The present is the only thing we have for certain, so why not make the best of it; by treating it like it is the peak of our health, wealth, social skills and so on.<\/p>\n<p>And how do we do that?<\/p>\n<p>By being grateful for what we have. It is only when we consciously\u00a0 recognize how lucky we are to have all the things that we do, do we start valuing it. Being able to move around on your own, see, hear, talk, travel, read, write, meet friends, drink coffee, enjoy a sunset or snow; little things that many people might not have the good fortune to experience.<\/p>\n<p>The world is like a nasty slot machine. Luck plays a huge role in almost everything we do, and it starts right at the moment you&#8217;re born. We are the product of our circumstances. There&#8217;s not much we can do about that, except that we recognize our privileges and act accordingly. Have a chance to do something good for someone? Do it. Realize your actions might&#8217;ve caused hurt? Apologize. Have people that pull you back? Filter.<\/p>\n<p>Time really is the only real currency that we have. While it does seem like a tragedy to not know how much more of it do we have left, I think it is a blessing in disguise. Think of the last time you had a deadline for an assignment. Did you wait for the very last moment to do it? If you&#8217;re like most people then probably yes. That&#8217;s probably what would happen if we knew exactly how long we have to live. We would procrastinate everything until the last moment, wasting away most of it. Fortunately for us, we don&#8217;t, and each day can be lived as if it is the deadline for that life&#8217;s assignment, doing the things that matter the most to us.<\/p>\n<p>So to summarize, there probably will never be a better time to do certain things, and that&#8217;s if you&#8217;re lucky to live a full life without many problems. If you&#8217;re in your teenage years, you probably have the time to learn something thoroughly, spend time with friends and family, have fun, see clearly if you&#8217;re into that. If you&#8217;re in your twenties, you have the best balance between intelligence, energy, time and maybe some money too. Later in life you get better with relationships, your emotional intelligence grows and the life experiences you accumulate make you wiser while you&#8217;re getting rusty physically. Basically, we live through different interpretations of &#8216;peak&#8217; throughout our lives, and there&#8217;s no one big peak that&#8217;s going to solve all your problems and make you happy.<\/p>\n<p>So make the most of your now; make memes, draw comics, write code, learn music, dance, sing, make someone&#8217;s day, be vulnerable, be nice, prioritize yourself, talk to random strangers and share stories, gift without a reason, sleep, cry, hug, do whatever you have to. But make your <em>now<\/em> count.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for reading!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Humans are fragile creatures.
