It started with Firefox being the only browser that could reliably resume downloads in the event of a power outage, which were frequent in my part of India, and that was <em>very<\/em> useful with a slow internet connection that gave me <a href=\"http:\/\/nagekar.com\/2020\/08\/a-tale-of-internet-speeds.html\">10KB\/s on a good day<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later I learned about free and open source software, and started thinking of the internet as a public resource and a great equalizer of access to knowledge and opportunity. Firefox was a very natural fit in this newly discovered world of mine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 8 years ago, I published <a href=\"http:\/\/nagekar.com\/2014\/12\/top-reasons-why-you-should-start-using.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"http:\/\/nagekar.com\/2014\/12\/top-reasons-why-you-should-start-using.html\">top reasons why you should start using Mozilla Firefox right now<\/a> documenting the various reasons why Firefox should be the browser of choice for anyone who desires a safe, private and customizable web browsing experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I&#8217;m now part of the organization that I&#8217;ve so long revered, I thought an update to the original post is appropriate, and started listing some reasons why Firefox is still my browser of choice today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am slightly biased towards Firefox, but in my defense that&#8217;s hardly ever changed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Features that enhance your web experience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons people love Firefox is its customizability. The functionality can be extended using <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/\">Addons<\/a> and for the truly adventurous, Firefox&#8217;s UI is customizable using a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.userchrome.org\/how-create-userchrome-css.html\">bit of custom CSS<\/a>. Given how personal web browsing is and how much time we spend using a browser, a bit of customization can go a long way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Powerful Adblocking with uBlock Origin<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>TL;DR from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ghostery.com\/blog\/manifest-v3-the-ghostery-perspective\">Ghostery<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>With enforcement of Manifest V3, Google dramatically limits capabilities of browser extensions. It removes access to powerful APIs that allowed us to provide innovation in privacy protection. Being subjected to those constraints, we have to re-invent the way our extensions operate.

A bit of custom CSS goes a long way into making the Browser look exactly the way you want. A popular workflow is <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@Aenon\/firefox-hide-native-tabs-and-titlebar-f0b00bdbb88b\">hiding the Tabs bar<\/a> and relying on Tree Style Tabs for inter-Tab navigation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Logo \ud83e\udd8a<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is very personal (that is, even more than the rest of this article), but I&#8217;m very fond of the Firefox logo. And as we&#8217;ve seen in the past, many people <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mozilla.org\/en\/firefox\/the-fox-is-still-in-the-firefox-logo\/\">feel very strongly about the Fox<\/a> in the logo so I&#8217;m not alone in feeling that way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Firefox Developer Edition<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/developer\/\">Firefox Developer Edition<\/a> as my work browser. It is really good if you work with frontend web technologies like CSS or JavaScript. Debugging CSS or JavaScript on the Developer Edition is a joy, and I was especially impressed at how good it was with <a href=\"https:\/\/mozilladevelopers.github.io\/playground\/css-grid\">Grids<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In closing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you had asked me 8 years ago why I recommend Firefox, I&#8217;d have gone on a long rant about how Firefox is one of the only two major non-Chromium based browsers, and the only one <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/en-US\/about\/manifesto\/\">supported by a non-profit<\/a> that fights to keep the web open and inclusive; That Firefox is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/en-US\/credits\/\">built and maintained with the help of thousands of volunteers<\/a> and open web enthusiasts and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I would just say I recommend it because it is a great browser. It is also all of the above if you care, but if all you care about is the best web experience, Firefox will serve you just fine. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/new\/\">Go give the Fox a try<\/a>!
