From the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/USB_hardware#Colors\">color of the port<\/a>, it is safe to conclude it is a USB 2.0 port, and not a USB 3.0 port. <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/USB_hardware#Power\">From Wikipedia<\/a>, we see that a USB 2.0 port intended for high power devices allows for a current draw of a<strong> minimum<\/strong> of 0.5 amps. The voltage is also standardized to 5 volts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amperes times Voltage gives us the power output of the port, which is 0.5 amps x 5 volts which is 2.5 watts (again, <strong>at a minimum<\/strong>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Measuring power consumption<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>2.5 watts is the power that can be drawn from the port. To calculate how much energy can be consumed over a given time period, we need to simply multiple the watt number by the time number. Typically, it is measured in watt-hours. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My electricity company bills me for the kilowatt-hours I consume. If I use my TV that&#8217;s rated at 100 watts for 10 hours, it will be billed as 1000Wh, or 1kWh of energy consumption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Price of electricity in my area<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Electricity does not cost the same everywhere, and not even in the same area. Even the same provider might use different prices depending on the time of consumption and a whole list of other factors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vattenfall.de\/stromtarife?plz=10179&amp;consumption=1100&amp;place=Berlin&amp;energyTypeSelected=electricity\">Looking at Vattenfall&#8217;s website<\/a> (an electricity provider here in Berlin), I can see prices range between 25.07 cents \/ kWh and 33.37 cents \/ kWh. To make it easy for calculations, I&#8217;m going to go with 30 cents \/ kWh (all <strong>\u20ac<\/strong> cents).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How much electricity can I buy for the cost of a BVG ticket?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For \u20ac3.20, the price of a single BVG ticket at the time of writing, I can consume (3.20 \/ 0.30) kWh, which is 10.667 kWh (or 10,667 Wh) of energy with my current electricity provide. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How long do I need to use the USB port to cover the cost of the ticket?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To find the time duration in which our 2.5W port will output 10,667Wh of energy, we simply need to divide the target consumption number by our consumption rate:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>10,667 (Wh) \/ 2.5 (W) = 4,266.8 hours (the Watt unit nicely cancels out giving us the number of hours)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Which is roughly 177.8 days, or just under 6 months.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time can roughly be cut by half if BVG changes the USB ports to 3.0 guaranteeing a minimum current draw of 900mA but I&#8217;m not holding my breath.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How much will a ticket effectively cost if I make full use of my ticket&#8217;s validity to charge a device?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now of course being in a bus for 6 months is going to cost more money for season ticket and I might never recover my full ticket. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what about the journey that I&#8217;ve already paid for? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bvg.de\/de\/abos-und-tickets\/alle-tickets\/einzelfahrscheine\/einzelfahrausweis\">A BVG single ticket is valid for 2 hours<\/a>. If I make 100% use of the time a ticket is valid for to charge my device, what&#8217;s the effective cost of my ticket?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a minimum of 2.5W for 2 hours, I&#8217;ll consume at least 5Wh. At 30 cents \/ kWh, that&#8217;s 0.15 cents worth of electricity. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s 0.15 cents or \u20ac0.0015 that I can immediately recover from my ticket price, <strong>effectively making my single journey BVG ticket cost not \u20ac3.20, but a jaw dropping \u20ac3.1985<\/strong> \ud83d\ude0e\ud83e\udee1<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you have it.
