That makes me one half of an engineer, as far as the certification thing is concerned. Apart from that, I would not consider myself anywhere near to what standards I have for an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nagekar.com\/2015\/03\/engineering.html\">Engineer<\/a> in my mind. Nevertheless, the results were displayed late last month, and I managed to clear all the subjects, proudly entering the 3rd year of the course.<\/p>\n<p>But since the exams, I did a few interesting things that I would like to let you know. Just after the exams, I took to <a href=\"https:\/\/qt.io\/\">Qt framework<\/a> in C++ which I did for the next one month or so. Not much, but I did the QWidget class well enough to have coded some <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/abhn\/Data-Destroyer-GUI\">simple GUIs<\/a>. It was quite interesting, and a useful asset that I think I own now. Later the interest turned towards web [again! :]. I started working on a social network written in Python, Django. I will update you once I get the base ready, and since it is the largest of all the projects I have worked on, I am quite proud and happy for it. Lastly, something even more amazing happened. I found my lost interest in Physics and Astronomy back. It is quite interesting, as to how it happened, but I will save that for a separate post.<\/p>\n<p>The past two months have been great, from my personal perspective. I have basically transformed into someone else, hopefully wiser than I was before. Hopefully. There is a strong reasoning I found for making that statement. I started reading a lot, doubting even more and I found that it opened doors to newer dimensions to living my life. Everything, everyone exists just because they do. That&#8217;s it. Nobody, nothing, especially the universe, owes you an explanation to things that seem incomprehensible. Learn to accept it. Maybe it is a part of growing up, which I seem to have realized now. For what it&#8217;s worth, I will still stay curious, for that is what drives me and most of the people. Good night.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was in June that I appeared for my 4th semester exam (we have 8 in all, 2 each year).
