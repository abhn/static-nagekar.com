But I wanted none of that, just a mouse that&#8217;s good to hold, wireless but not Bluetooth, and is fairly accurate with a couple of extra buttons that can be customized to custom actions. I stumbled upon G305 from Logitech which had their premium HERO sensor with 12,000 DPI and good battery life. It has good reviews on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/results?search_query=logitech+g305\">Youtube<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.de\/Logitech-Kabellose-Gaming-Maus-Hero-Sensor-programmierbaren\/dp\/B07CGNDZR3\/\">Amazon DE<\/a> and was fairly cheap at EUR 43.\n<\/p>\n<h3>Initial impressions and build<\/h3>\n<figure>\n  <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/logitech-mouse-contents-scaled.jpg\"\/><br \/>\n<\/figure>\n<p>\n  In a nice little box, we find the mouse itself along with colorful paperwork, a Logitech sticker, USB-A extension and a Duracell AA battery. The mouse had the USB receiver inside it. After inserting the battery into the mouse, it does become a bit heavy. I like how solid it feels, but apparently more weight is bad when it comes to gaming mice. I&#8217;ve been away from both, gaming and physical mice for about 7 years now, so it was good to know, and is something to consider if you&#8217;re actually going to game with it.\n<\/p>\n<h3>No RGB<\/h3>\n<p>\n  Another thing to note is that many gaming mice, even the ones half the price of this (albeit from no-name brands), come with RGB lighting. This one doesn&#8217;t but that&#8217;s not a problem for me.\n<\/p>\n<h3>Pointer speed toggle<\/h3>\n<figure>\n  <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/logitech-mouse-light-scaled.jpg\"\/><br \/>\n<\/figure>\n<p>\n  There&#8217;s a button right behind the scroll wheel that changes the speed of the mouse pointer speed. It has four levels, and each level has a different colored LED indicator that lights up when it is toggled. Pretty sleek and handy.\n<\/p>\n<h3>Utility buttons<\/h3>\n<figure>\n  <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/logitech-mouse-top-view-scaled.jpg\"\/><br \/>\n<\/figure>\n<p>\n  There are two utility buttons on the side which don&#8217;t do anything by default on Ubuntu (they did navigate to the next\/previous tab in Chromium by default though). I used <code>xev<\/code> to find their button codes and then xbindkeys to bind them to toggle previous\/next workspace in Ubuntu with the following\n<\/p>\n<pre>\n# in .xbindkeysrc\n\"xdotool set_desktop --relative -- -1\"\n  b:9\n\n\"xdotool set_desktop --relative 1\"\n  b:8\n<\/pre>\n<p>\n  Install <code>xdotool<\/code> if you don&#8217;t have it already.\n<\/p>\n<h3>In closing<\/h3>\n<p>\n  I am really enjoying this mouse, and have no problems so far. It is nice to have the Thinkpad clit mouse when typing\/working and using the mouse when casually surfing the web (like browsing Youtube). I&#8217;ll post a little review of the new keyboard soon and if you&#8217;d like to know when I do, you might want to subscribe to the RSS feeds of my blog.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was looking for an ergonomic mouse for my workstation upgrade (this mouse is one of the many things I&#8217;m adding to my work\/hobby setup) and stumbled upon a lot of expensive gaming mice with RGB, scroll wheel and other fancy stuff.
