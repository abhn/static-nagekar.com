Before that, it was all tiny bits here and there, virtualbox and stuff like that. But then, I finally made my mind to replace the Windows based OS that I was running for Linux. Trust me, it was a very scary decision at that time, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.backtrack-linux.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Backtrack 5<\/a> was my first full time Linux distro.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFrom there, it was an ultimate goal to try out every major distro. I used Backtrack till version 5r3 when they dropped support. Then I tried Ubuntu, since I had read Backtrack was Ubuntu based. Switched to Kali Linux, for it was the latest. After that was CentOS 6. I remember using it because I had the same on my DigitalOcean VPS. VPS gone, it was time to switch. I tried Fedora, but GNOME 3 didn&#8217;t appeal to me, and still at this point, I was unaware of what a desktop environment was, or how do I change one. Later I switched to Debian 7, which was when I fell in love with it. Attended the launch party of Debian 8 and started using it right away. Debian stable had some really outdated packages, and the GNOME environment didn&#8217;t appeal to me either. I installed Debian testing, running XFCE. It was the setup I always needed and is still my daily driver. In the meantime, I tried OpenSUSE too, but nothing great. As you see, I don&#8217;t really need a reason to switch distros.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhat really provoked me was a sentence that I read somewhere, &#8216;if you have not used Slackware or Gentoo, you really have not used Linux&#8217;. It was 3 years ago. Since then, I had multiple tries at installing Slackware, Gentoo and Arch, but somehow, I would mess some thing up and it would be a failure. You should note here that installing these systems is not as easy a task, especially when you don&#8217;t understand the commands you are typing. This time was nothing different. I downloaded the ISO which was surprisingly just some ~250MBs. I burnt it to a disk and booted it up.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe most scary part of it all is that there is no &#8216;installer&#8217;. You have to manually create partitions, the swap and the bootloader. Then there is the phase to download the &#8216;stage3&#8217; file to the root and untaring it. Chrooting into it, setting up a few things like network, downloading the kernel source, compiling it and adding it to the \/boot directory and then the hardest stage. Reboot. Hard emotionally, that is. After a minute, you are either greeted by the login prompt, or you realize that the past 8 hours of your life went in vain.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLuckily for me though, it booted up. It was after midnight when it booted up, and I was installing it since 2pm. I&#8217;m a noob. It is not a lot different than other distros, if you know how to <i>make<\/i> softwares. There is this package manager called <i>emerge<\/i> which is helpful too (it downloads sources and builds it, resolving dependencies). I am currently running it command line, as I didn&#8217;t setup the Xorg during installation. It is pretty usable, and the best part is that you actually understand your system. I realized that this is a great way to actually learn GNU\/Linux. The thing that I have to live with is that since each and every installation is by compiling source, it is damn slow. Usually 15-30 minutes for most applications. The plus point is that since it is build on my particular system, the executable is smaller than usual (and I read it is faster too). Cool, right?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tI am looking forward to using it everyday on my PC, at least for sometime till I get really good at it. Maybe then I&#8217;ll try doing the same on my laptop, which would be nice. For now, I&#8217;ll have to figure out a way to install Xorg.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I started using GNU\/Linux full time sometime in 2011.
