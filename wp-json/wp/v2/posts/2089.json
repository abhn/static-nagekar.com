Missing my connecting flight, losing my luggage due to that and landing in a completely dark, freezing and rainy Berlin wasn&#8217;t pleasant, but it also wasn&#8217;t that tough. I was just happy that I finally stepped foot in another country, and given how long I prepared for this journey, I was glad it had finally started. The kind HR person from the company I was about to join was at the airport to pick me up which I&#8217;m extremely grateful for to this day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4032\" height=\"2016\" src=\"http:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2090\" srcset=\"https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image.png 4032w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-250x125.png 250w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-768x384.png 768w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-1536x768.png 1536w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-2048x1024.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first super market trip was nerve wrecking, and not just because I only had 100 Euro bills with me and was worried I&#8217;ll get yelled at by the cashier. But I managed to have dinner that night (as depicted in my picture above), and sleep well. And then to my surprise I also managed to survive the rest of the week. And the rest of the month, and the year, and then some.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did more than just survive, as one ought to aspire for. I made friends, traveled to pretty places and ate good food. I learned a new language and experienced a culture that was totally foreign just five years ago. I learned to play a musical instrument, <a href=\"http:\/\/nagekar.com\/2020\/12\/1500-elo-lichess.html\">play chess<\/a> and cook tasty food. I did a lot of what I had only dreamed of, including landing my dream job at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/en-US\/\">Mozilla<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reminiscing on the time <a href=\"\/2019\/01\/mumbai-to-berlin.html\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"\/2019\/01\/mumbai-to-berlin.html\">from my first day in Berlin<\/a> till today, I have a lot to be grateful for, lot to smile about and a lot of notes on how to do better in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m writing this eating delicious <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tangyuan_(food)\">glutinous rice ball dessert<\/a>, to celebrate the little milestone. The past few years brought us all a lot of changes, and it feels like the world is caught in turbulence. I wonder if I am only thinking so because I&#8217;m getting older and tend to pay more attention to what&#8217;s happening around me, or if everything is actually happening faster. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was undoubtedly an interesting journey living through these last five years here in Berlin, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the next.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some 1,826 days ago I arrived at Berlin Tegel Airport.
