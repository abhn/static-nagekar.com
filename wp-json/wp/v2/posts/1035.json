I thought it would be a good DIY project to work on and was less than 4 euros at that time. But since I don&#8217;t have something like the <a href=\"\/2018\/05\/banggoods-india-direct-mail-shipping.html\">India Direct Mail<\/a> shipping here in Germany, the delivery took a month. I was very skeptic if it will ever make it, given that it was a super-cheap, super-fragile little DIY kit. But it did.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Upon receiving it, I soldered the kit together with the soldering station that I received as a birthday present, and headed out to a hobby electronics store to get a variable power supply. Turned out, even the simplest of them cost more than EUR40 in the brick and mortar stores here in Berlin. I wasn&#8217;t willing to spend that much to power this little kit. I had to go back to Banggood.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Not wasting any more time, I ordered a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.banggood.com\/Minleaf-96W-12V-24V-Regulated-Output-Power-Supply-Adapter-AC-DC-Power-Adapter-Charger-p-981672.html\">12-24V 4.5A supply from Banggood<\/a> for less than EUR10. Knowing well that this time it would take more than a month on account of the holidays in the middle, I forgot about it. That was until today, when it arrived at my work. Full of excitement, I got home and powered this project up! Here&#8217;s a glimpse from during the testing.\n<\/p>\n<style>\n.videowrapper {\n    float: none;\n    clear: both;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n    padding-bottom: 56.25%;\n    padding-top: 25px;\n    height: 0;\n}\n.videowrapper iframe {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n}\n<\/style>\n<div class=\"videowrapper\">\n  <iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/C1zDznzVQwQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div>\n<p>\n  To go along with this project, I have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.banggood.com\/DSP-PLL-Digital-Stereo-FM-Radio-Receiver-Module-87-108MHz-With-Serial-Control-p-1004778.html?rmmds=myorder\">FM radio module<\/a> that I&#8217;ll hook up with this Tesla Coil speaker.
