So I think we can really say I&#8217;m making this a thing going forward. But that&#8217;s okay, as there&#8217;s something happening around this time every year. This year our senses are clogged by the news from the pandemic going on around the world which I touched upon a bit <a href=\"\/2020\/04\/coronavirus-gratitude.html\">back in April<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Compared to April, things are much better right now here in Germany. We can go out and meet friends, eat at restaurants and shop for our favourite stuff. Life&#8217;s slowly getting back to normal, although there&#8217;s still that element of fear of catching the virus. Things aren&#8217;t as good in India, so it is anyone&#8217;s guess when I get to visit home next  \u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  As for my blog, this year wasn&#8217;t super active apart from a few posts and some cosmetic changes to the template. An interesting moment was <a href=\"\/2020\/05\/python-io-benchmarks.html\">a blog post<\/a> getting featured in <a href=\"https:\/\/realpython.com\/\">RealPython<\/a>&#8216;s newsletter! I&#8217;m quite proud of that.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  I want to move the blog away from Jekyll, maybe to something Python based. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love Jekyll on Github Pages, but it is just too straightforward with rarely any problems to fix. I want something that&#8217;d break, allowing me to fix things and learn. But all of that is still to happen. Hopefully I find a stretch of time to finally make the move to a different blogging platform in the near future.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  As for the rest of the year, I plan on making my workstation a little better, so expect small tech gear reviews here and there from the purchases I make. You can also expect more on Python programming and infosec as that&#8217;s on the agenda. So yeah, that&#8217;s it for this blog birthday celebration on a slow lazy Sunday afternoon. Cheers, I&#8217;ll see you in the next one.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Thank you for reading!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I wrote a blog birthday blog post last year, and the year before that and for whatever reason, one after the first year but none in between.
