I was wow-ing the entire time at probably one of the most impressive pieces of architecture I&#8217;ve ever witnessed with my own eyes. If you do get a chance, I&#8217;d highly recommend paying it a visit. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we started our hike from the Schloss Wilhelmsh\u00f6he and started climbing the hundreds of steps that lead all the way up to the Hercules monument. I read somewhere it is a 250 meter elevation. Whenever I paused to take a look at how high I had reached, it got more and more impressive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was eager to reach the top. I tried to rush my way through some of the points of interests along the way to reach ever so higher to get a better view. I had my little camera with me, and I wanted to get the best view. Finally, we reached the top of the hill, but there was a whole building up there, on top of which was the Hercules statue. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I wanted the best view, so I started going up the stairs of the building trying to get ever so higher. The stairs got narrower and narrower as I rushed to the top. But finally, I was there and tried to look outside through the small windows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The view was underwhelming. It was more or less the same that we&#8217;d been seeing for some time during this hike up the tower but this time through tiny windows that had a lot of dust built upon them. I took a picture, and started walking down after not too long up there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was thinking about it in the car on the way back to Berlin, and I realized this is just how I sometimes go about my life; rushing towards a goal while not appreciating the views along the way, thinking something better awaits me at the end of it. I&#8217;d have slowed down, had I known how little joy the reaching the destination would bring. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, I could appreciate everything a bit more on the way down the hill. Unfortunately the same cannot be done with passed time and experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In closing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We live we learn, and such experiences are always a good reminder to slow down and appreciate the <em>views<\/em> around us; appreciate the present consciously and intentionally for it cannot be re-experienced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last Sunday I visited the Bergpark Wilhelmsh\u00f6he near Kassel, Germany.
