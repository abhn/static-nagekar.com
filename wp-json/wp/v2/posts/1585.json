I&#8217;ve not written a birthday post in a while (last time was <a href=\"\/2019\/10\/twentyfour.html\">turning 24<\/a>, three years ago) so decided to write something for this one. Not that 27 is a special year or anything (well, I guess it is (un)special in the sense that it only comes once in a lifetime). However I do somehow feel 27 is a round number. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is hard to explain, but I think I&#8217;m at the line that separates an early adult and a full real adult. It&#8217;s complicated, and I feel like neither to be very honest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year was quite exciting, from settling into my new role at CareerFoundry as a web &amp; security engineer, to traveling around a bit, to getting my dream flat in the Neuk\u00f6lln district of Berlin (only to lose it six months later, but hey, not everything has to work out :), to getting my dream job at Mozilla, it has been a really happening year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to this year. New job, new apartment, new part of the city, new technologies to learn and master. So much to be excited about. I decided to write more starting on my birthday, and I&#8217;ve been seeing good progress in the last month and a half since then. I&#8217;ll document my note-taking habit in an article about Obsidian soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope for the next one year is to get some stability into my life which got a bit rough in H2. Also hope to do well at work and life in general, but we&#8217;ll see that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently I&#8217;m into this game called Life is Strange and have been listening to sound tracks from it. I play chess around once or twice per day, and sometimes paint. <\/p>\n\n\n<p><script async=\"\" src=\"\/\/www.instagram.com\/embed.js\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pd2wP1Ik0_Y\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Work takes up most of my time, but that&#8217;s expected and I&#8217;m really enjoying the new learnings coming my way. Overall, life&#8217;s good.
