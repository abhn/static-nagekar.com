The books from this publishing house are everything what a Mumbai University guy needs to study for exam. Well, not exactly, but that&#8217;s how most see this book as.<\/p>\n<p>So when I was reading it, I noticed that much of what I read in the book was something I already read someplace else. A quick browser history lookup revealed that the stuff were taken from Wikipedia. Wait, let me rephrase it, <i>the stuff were copied and pasted from Wikipedia<\/i>, including the text, images and caption.<\/p>\n<p>For your information, the content of Wikipedia is licensed under <a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/3.0\/\" target=\"_blank\">creative commons attribution share-alike 3.0<\/a>.

The content copied by Techmax shows no attribution, no credits to Wikipedia or it&#8217;s authors, and the worst, they have copyrighted the book under their name and it&#8217;s totally restricted.\n<\/p>\n<p>  <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/20150613_122354.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here is a piece of text from <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Copyrights\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Copyrights<\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p>To re-distribute text on Wikipedia in any form, provide credit to the authors either by including a) a hyperlink (where possible) or URL  to the page or pages you are re-using, b) a hyperlink (where possible)  or URL to an alternative, stable online copy which is freely accessible,  which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the  authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on this website, or  c) a list of all authors. (Any list of authors may be filtered to  exclude very small or irrelevant contributions.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So it is mandatory for TechMax to provide a backlink to the webpage they are lifting the content from. At least a bibliography at the end of the book. The second part to this is copyleft\/share-alike policy.

They should consider revising their license.\n<\/p>\n<p>And finally, as far as the students are concerned, why not just take a little more effort and learn from the web instead of a printed version of the web.<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Edit<\/b>. A little proof of what I am talking about.
