A huge metropolitan city with double-decker buses, zoo, planetarium etc was sure exciting for a kid. Even as a young adult, my university friends and I would take the train to the city center to sit by the water front at Marine Drive or Bandstand. The city of Mumbai has fascinated me for a long time, and I&#8217;ve always wondered what it must be like to live in the center.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, living in the fancy areas of downtown Mumbai is close to impossible if you don&#8217;t already live there or are extremely wealthy. Since I was neither, it always remained a wonder. Back in the day perhaps I&#8217;d have said that I&#8217;d love a home in the city center, but lately I&#8217;m over that thought. The steeply rising prices, the commodification of places of residence and prevailing view of buying a home as sort of a financial investment has been quite off-putting for me, to the point where I no longer desire to own my own place in the city. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ve stopped being fascinated by the idea of living in downtown Mumbai.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately for me, a friend was visiting Mumbai and decided to book a room in one of the poshiest parts of the city; Marine Drive. The &#8220;fortunately&#8221; part is about him booking a room big enough to accommodate me during his three day stay in the city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Living at Marine Drive<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So how does it feel to living at <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Marine_Drive,_Mumbai\">Marine Drive<\/a>? Amazing. With a sea view, the sunsets are a delight to see from a french style full height glass windows. I could see all the people sitting exactly where my friends, family and I have sat numerous times. I woke up early to go for a morning walk and grabed a coffee along the way, something I literally dreamed of doing for years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eating casually at some very good restaurants, or going to a evening musical at the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Royal_Opera_House_(Mumbai)\">Opera House<\/a> just a short walk away or having problems like having to travel quite far up north to get to the &#8220;regular&#8221; part of the city were a delight and I felt extremely privileged and fortunately to be experiencing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In closing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet another of those silly bucket list items got ticked. Sure, living the permanently would be cooler, but this is probably a close second. Or perhaps living there permanently wouldn&#8217;t have made me appreciate it as much as I did now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as I was living in that hotel room, I knew how much I&#8217;m going to miss the couple of days that I&#8217;ll spend there. Now, as I&#8217;m writing this, I can see how my past self very accurately predicted that. I&#8217;ll end with a picture of sunset over Arabian sea from the hotel room&#8217;s window.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3664\" height=\"2748\" src=\"http:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/image.png\" alt=\"view of marine drive from my hotel room\" class=\"wp-image-2068\" srcset=\"https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/image.png 3664w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/image-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/image-250x188.png 250w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/image-768x576.png 768w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/image-1536x1152.png 1536w, https:\/\/nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/image-2048x1536.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 3664px) 100vw, 3664px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When I was little, going to downtown Mumbai used to be exciting.
