It feels like just a few weeks ago that I arrived in a cold grey Berlin <a href=\"https:\/\/nagekar.com\/2019\/01\/mumbai-to-berlin.html\">for the first time<\/a>, having lost a suitcase. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=days+since+7th+jan+2019\">But it was 2,192 days ago<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day I arrived here wasn&#8217;t my best, and the next few weren&#8217;t much better either. But eventually, things worked out and the city really grew on me. Let me rephrase. Cities don&#8217;t grow on people. It is the people, the experiences and the sense of belonging that makes us feel home. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year before I moved to Berlin, I was living in Nahur, Mumbai trying to make sense of why one set of walls feel like home while the other just a place to sleep. What makes a home, <a href=\"https:\/\/nagekar.com\/2018\/02\/home.html\">home<\/a>? Fortunately for me, the important lessons learned then were used time and again whenever I wanted to feel homely in this foreign city, in a foreign country. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I&#8217;m crowd sourcing some new year resolutions from my close friends inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/moxie.org\/stories\/year-of-the-challenge\/\">Moxie<\/a>, and trying to shape the year forward to the best of my abilities. It has been a busy week at work, since everyone is back from vacations. That, and catching up with people that I hadn&#8217;t see in sometime means I&#8217;m having a packed week. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I still wanted to find some time to write this article. It is a way of snapshotting this moment in time. Lots of positive changes over the last couple of weeks including a visit to CCC Congress, Freiburg, reading books like Tuedays with Morrie and The Last Lecture and a lot of introspection. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The books and the introspection gave me a profound realization that the passage of time doesn&#8217;t stop, and it passes fast if we don&#8217;t keep moving, keep growing in life. Not only am I getting older, but so are the people around me. If there&#8217;s something I really want to do, now is a good time. <a href=\"https:\/\/nagekar.com\/2021\/02\/the-best-time-of-your-life-is-right-now.html\">I knew this<\/a>, of course. I just had forgotten it lately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading! <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy new year! Time flies.
