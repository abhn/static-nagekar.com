In coal mines, there&#8217;s always a danger of increased levels of hazardous gases. The canaries served as a warning system for the mine workers. When concentration of hazardous gases increased beyond what&#8217;s normal, the canary would die, warning the mine workers to leave before it gets dangerous for human beings (and hence the phrase <a href=\"https:\/\/english.stackexchange.com\/questions\/102939\/what-is-a-canary-in-a-coal-mine\">canary in a coal mine<\/a>).\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  A warranty canary serves a similar purpose for users of a website. In US (unsure about other nations), the governments and national security agencies can secretly order any organization to hand over user\/customer data, and along with that order comes a gag prohibiting that company from discussing the order with anyone (its users, for example). Now internet companies needed a way to still circumvent this gag order (and maintain trust with their users, especially for companies like VPN and mail providers where trust is critical), and that&#8217;s where the canary comes into picture.\n<\/p>\n<h3>Warranty Canary<\/h3>\n<figure>\n  <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/librem-warranty-canary.png\"\/><figcaption>Librem Hardware warranty canary<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\n  The &#8216;warranty canary&#8217; is a line of text mentioned on the website stating something similar to this:\n<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Until now we have not received any letters, gag orders or warrants from any government\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\n  That&#8217;s it. This line says that the organization has never received any of the said requests. Once they do get such a request, they have to adhere to it. When they do, they remove the canary, hinting to their customers\/users that their systems have been compromised by some government body but not violating the gag order that might be associated with the request. Clever!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  For examples, see <a href=\"https:\/\/nordvpn.com\/about-us\/\">NordVPN<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/transparency\/\">Cloudflare<\/a>. For a list of major companies with warranty canaries, see the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Warrant_canary\">Wikipedia page<\/a>. It can be seen that Apple and Reddit removed their warranty canaries which may indicate that they had been contacted by intelligence agencies.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  That&#8217;s it for this little ELI5.
