Enjoy!<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Nonsense! We will never be rid of code, because code represents the details of the requirements. At some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they have to be specified. And specifying requirements in such detail that a machine can execute them is programming. Such a specification is code.\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Of course you have been impeded by bad code. So then\u2014why did you write it? Were you trying to go fast? Were you in a rush? Probably so. Perhaps you felt that you didn\u2019t have time to do a good job; that your boss would be angry with you if you took the time to clean up your code. Perhaps you were just tired of working on this program and wanted it to be over. Or maybe you looked at the backlog of other stuff that you had promised to get done and realized that you needed to slam this module together so you could move on to the next. We\u2019ve all done it.\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but that\u2019s their job. It\u2019s your job to defend the code with equal passion. To drive this point home, what if you were a doctor and had a patient who demanded that you stop all the silly hand-washing in preparation for surgery because it was taking too much time?2 Clearly the patient is the boss; and yet the doctor should absolutely refuse to comply. Why? Because the doctor knows more than the patient about the risks of disease and infection. It would be unprofessional (never mind criminal) for the doctor to comply with the patient. So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don\u2019t understand the risks of making messes. The Primal Conundrum Programmers face a conundrum of basic values.\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious that you can do to make it better. All of those things were thought about by the code\u2019s author, and if you try to imagine improvements, you\u2019re led back to where you are, sitting in appreciation of the code someone left for you\u2014code left by someone who cares deeply about the craft.\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Will update from time to time&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for reading!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Listing down some interesting quotes I read in Clean Code by Robert Martin.
