In this one, I&#8217;ll try to explain DES in my own words, testing my own understanding and giving you a (hopefully) nice read from a novice perspective. So let&#8217;s get started with DES, a cipher that was once the standard for government data encryption for the US and many others around the globe, now defunct and only exists, if at all, in form of 3DES.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Before we begin, let us understand where we are (with DES) in the cryptoverse and then talk about DES itself. In cryptography, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Encryption\">encryption<\/a> of data can happen in two ways. There&#8217;s symmetric cryptography, and there&#8217;s asymmetric cryptography. In symmetric key cryptography, we have block ciphers and stream ciphers. DES is a block cipher.\n<\/p>\n<h3>A Brief History<\/h3>\n<p>\n    DES, for Data Encryption Standard, is a symmetric key encryption algorithm proposed by IBM with inputs from the NSA in 1974. Not many details about the development process were shared with the world. It is studied by numerous experts and counts as one of the most studied ciphers of all time. DES was designed to keep government secrets, secrets.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    The 56 bit key size didn&#8217;t impress anyone back in the day, much less today. In spite of a small key size, there weren&#8217;t any attacks faster than brute force, both theoretically and practically, until into the late 80s when Adi Shamir and Eli Biham discovered a new kind of attack on block ciphers called differential cryptanalysis. The world then learnt that NSA and IBM knew about this attack since at least 1974, and the algorithm was designed specifically to counter this attack.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    In late 90s DES was practically cracked in a contest and then many times after that. The main weakness in DES was the small key size, and to patch it, 3DES was proposed which is still used today, although not recommended. But from an academic point of view, DES is a gold mine. It is easy to understand, let&#8217;s us deep dive into the way cryptographers think and learn why certain decisions are made, and most importantly, why the <i>math just works!<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<h3>DES algorithm from 10,000ft<\/h3>\n<p>\n    Okay, let&#8217;s start with a super complex diagram that you probably won&#8217;t understand without 4 years of formal training in mathematics. Just kidding.\n<\/p>\n<p><center><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/top1.png\"\/><\/center><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    And for the sake of my love for bullet points,\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>DES is a Feistel cipher, which is a family of ciphers which are iterative in nature (repeat a simple set of instructions several times, called &#8217;rounds&#8217;) and share many similar properties.<\/li>\n<li>DES has a block size of 64 bits, that is, 64 bits of plaintext is converted into 64 bits of ciphertext in one go.<\/li>\n<li>The algorithm makes use of a 64 bit key, 56 of which are used by the algorithm and 8 are used for parity check. Effective security is 56 bits.<\/li>\n<li>DES has 16 rounds.<\/li>\n<li>The encryption and decryption functions are almost similar, which is a great advantage as the implementation and audit has to be done for single function only, simplifying things.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n    So how does the algorithm work? Like any other algorithm, you can put it down as a list of easy to understand steps.<br \/>\n    <center><br \/>\n        <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/DES-main-network.png\" width=\"50%\"\/><br \/>\n        <i>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:DES-main-network.png<\/i><br \/>\n    <\/center><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take input as plaintext block of 64 bits, and key K<\/li>\n<li>Apply Initial Permutation (IP) on input plaintext (which shuffles the bits in a predefined manner)<\/li>\n<li>Split the input into left half and right half (L<sub>0<\/sub> and R<sub>0<\/sub>) (form two equal halves of 32 bits, no tricks)<\/li>\n<li>Apply magic function F (not really) on the right half R<sub>0<\/sub> (32 bits input => 32 bits output)<\/li>\n<li>Function F takes R<sub>0<\/sub> and K<sub>1<\/sub> as input, where R<sub>0<\/sub> is the right halve (32 bit) input for the 1<sup>st<\/sup> round and K<sub>1<\/sub> is the 1<sup>st<\/sup> round key.

Now that we have a basic flow, we can take on each of the components and talk about them in detail, in a proper top down approach.\n<\/p>\n<h3>Little aside on confusion and diffusion<\/h3>\n<p>\n    Confusion and diffusion are exactly what they mean in plain English. They provide confusion and diffusion properties in the ciphertext. They are crucial for the overall security of the DES algorithm.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Confusion<\/strong> means having a non-linear, complex relationship between the key and the ciphertext. In simple words, each bit of the ciphertext has to depend on as many bits in the key as possible, such that even with a choosen ciphertext attack scenario, not much can be known about the key given a practically infinite supply of plaintext-ciphertext pairs.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Diffusion<\/strong> means any change in the plaintext should cause an avalanche\/snowball effect and change around half of the bits in the ciphertext and vice versa.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    We will talk more about how DES achieves both of these properties when we talk about the F function in detail.\n<\/p>\n<h3>DES algorithm: Major parts<\/h3>\n<p><center><br \/>\n    <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/top2.png\"\/><br \/>\n    <i>Please take a moment to appreciate the effort I&#8217;ve put into the diagram.

In decryption, the ciphertext goes into the FP and plaintext leaves through IP, similar but exact opposite of encryption, which is one of the properties of a Feistel cipher. From functionality perspective, it shuffles the 64 bit input block according to a predefined vector, given below.\n<\/p>\n<pre>\n<b>IP<\/b>\n58    50   42    34    26   18    10    2\n60    52   44    36    28   20    12    4\n62    54   46    38    30   22    14    6\n64    56   48    40    32   24    16    8\n57    49   41    33    25   17     9    1\n59    51   43    35    27   19    11    3\n61    53   45    37    29   21    13    5\n63    55   47    39    31   23    15    7<\/pre>\n<p>\n    The above text is a linear list, or a vector, and not a matrix.

It is basically a one-to-one substitution. So how does it, one might ask, help in adding security if the list is public and it is a simple substitution operation. Well, it does not.

The magic function F isn&#8217;t really magical.

E function takes those 32 bits of input and expands them to 48 bits. How it does that? Well, repetition, of course. So it basically takes input as <code>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8<\/code> and outputs something like <code>1 2 2 3 4 4 5 6 6 7 8 8<\/code>, effectively increasing the size by 50% (32 => 48).\n    <\/p>\n<h5>XOR with round key<\/h5>\n<p>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cs.umd.edu\/class\/sum2003\/cmsc311\/Notes\/BitOp\/xor.html\">XOR<\/a> is a simple mathematical operation that has a very important property from a cryptographic standpoint. If you XOR a number A with B, you get a new number C. To get A from C, you need B. To get B from C, you need A. Basically, <code>A \u2295 B \u2295 B = A<\/code>, and <code>A \u2295 B \u2295 A = B<\/code>. XORing plaintext and key locks them in a interdependent mixture such that to get back the plaintext, you <i>have to have<\/i> the key with which it was XORed (locked).\n    <\/p>\n<h5>S-box substitution<\/h5>\n<p>\n        In some ways, this is the heart of the algorithm. <b>S-box substitution gives us confusion<\/b>. There are eight S-boxes in total, each taking 6 input bits and giving 4 output bits. S-boxes provide DES immunity against <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quadibloc.com\/crypto\/co040501.htm\">differential cryptanalysis<\/a> which I mentioned at the beginning of this article.

That is the output of S-box 1 for input <code>110101<\/code>. Similarly do this for S-box 2-8, for each of the 16 rounds of DES. The result of the 8 S-boxes (4 bits each) is combined to get a 32 bit output.\n    <\/p>\n<h5>Permutation<\/h5>\n<p>\n        The final step of our magic function F is a simple one-to-one permutation, taking 32 bits and returning 32 bits.\n    <\/p>\n<pre>\n16   7   20  21\n29   12  28  17\n 1   15  23  26\n 5   18  31  10\n 2    8  24  14\n32   27   3   9\n19   13  30   6\n22   11   4  25<\/pre>\n<\/p>\n<h3>Catch your breath<\/h3>\n<p><center><br \/>\n    <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nagekar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/top2.png\"\/><br \/>\n    <i>I&#8217;m really too proud of this picture.
