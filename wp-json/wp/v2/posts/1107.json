Android and Java were technologies I never thought I would learn by myself. I always felt they were overcomplicated and for me that translated to boring. I was, of course, wrong as things started to become clear.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMy friend Kunal really inspired me to take on Android. He guided me with basics of Java that I covered by reading the first 12 chapters of the book &#8220;Java The Complete Reference&#8221;. After that Kunal even went ahead to give me a hands on session on the basics of Android.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNow to be honest, I can write basic Android applications, but anything above that would require extensive Googling. Partly because once I knew I won&#8217;t need to learn anymore to complete the project, I stopped. But inspite of all that, there were a few great experiences that I wanted to share here about my short journey with Java and Android.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe most amazing thing I learned was that Java is a great language to learn object oriented programming concepts. Interface, abstract class, method overloading and overriding were just words for me before diving head first into Android. I understood the meaning, and I could even write you the classic sample Animal<->Dog,Cat example to demonstrate all of those, but I never actually saw their potential application in any of my projects. Get started with Android and in a day you&#8217;ll realize what those terms actually look like in practice and suddenly it all starts to make sense.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnother thing that I noticed in the Android ecosystem is that Android is far more stable than most of the other technologies that I deal with, or have dealt with. I remember my time with Angular 2. Issues used to pop up and the only thing that showed up when you Google your problems was a Github issue created 3 days ago with 17 comments saying &#8220;Same problem here&#8221;. It was horrible, and it intensifies when you&#8217;re using it to build something professionally for a third party, and not just a random side project. Android felt much more like C++, predictable, readily available resources on Q&amp;A sites like StackOverflow, and a standardized way of doing things.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLastly, a subjective realization. Android is a powerful tool in any developer&#8217;s toolkit. It is the midway between web and system, with the ease and straightforwardness of the web and the power and reach of system. It is fascinating to a naive code guy like me to grasp what all is possible in Android. The APIs make just about everything accessible to the developer, and I&#8217;m not even going to get started on the reach of Android. Look, imagine this. It&#8217;s like knowing how to hack Raspberry Pi with your kick-ass Python, but in this case, every damn person you know has a Pi, carries one around, and it is connected to the Internet all the time. Now that is the kind of power we&#8217;re talking about here.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn closing, if you&#8217;re like me who just does something for the sake of that momentary joy of learning something new, give Android a try. Apart from all the good stuff that I&#8217;ve mentioned above, it is just a great feeling to try something new, right?
