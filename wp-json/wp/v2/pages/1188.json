The Thinkpad runs Fedora Linux with GNOME these days.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, I owned a <a style=\"pointer-events: none;\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"\/2015\/11\/Fujitsu-Lifebook-A514-Review.html\">Fujitsu Lifebook A514<\/a> and a <a style=\"pointer-events: none;\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"\/2018\/05\/lenovo-thinkpad-t440-ebay-refurbished-laptop-review.html\">Lenovo Thinkpad T440<\/a>. My work computer was a <a style=\"pointer-events: none;\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"\/2019\/03\/experiences-with-macbook-and-macos.html\">2017 Macbook Pro<\/a>. My last work computer was a Thinkpad T14 AMD Gen 1. I also have a spare Macbook Pro late 2015 edition that&#8217;s still very functional for notes, web browsing etc.<\/p>\n<h3>Displays<\/h3>\n<p><del>I have my work monitor, a Dell U2719D 27in 1440p IPS display and another monitor that I bought myself, a Dell P2419H 24in 1080p IPS display. I hardly use my X230 with my monitors, primarily because to use both the displays, I have to use the docking station.<\/del><\/p>\n<p>Update 27.12.22: CF monitor returned, 24in Dell sold. New work monitor is Dell U2723Q.<\/p>\n<h3>Keyboard and mouse<\/h3>\n<p>I absolutely love Thinkpad keyboards and the trackpoint, but while at home I prefer my external keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is an <a style=\"pointer-events: none;\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"\/2020\/07\/ikbc-mf108-v3-ansi-unboxing-review.html\">IKBC MF108<\/a> mechanical keyboard with blue switches and the mouse is <a style=\"pointer-events: none;\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"\/2020\/07\/logitech-g305-gaming-mouse-review.html\">Logitech G305<\/a> budget gaming mouse. My work keyboard is a full sized Apple Magic Keyboard.<\/p>\n<h3>Sound and music<\/h3>\n<p>I bought a Tribit Maxboom bluetooth speaker shortly after coming to Germany. That&#8217;s still my primary music source. <del>For video calls and outdoors, I have cheap in ears called piston fit from a company called 1more.<\/del> I bought Sony WH1000-XM4s for my birthday back in 2020 October and still use them to this date for calls etc.<\/p>\n<h3>Storage and backup<\/h3>\n<p>I got myself a WD Elements 5 TB hard drive for backing up files. I also have a 500GB spinning disk hard drive from my <a style=\"pointer-events: none;\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"\/2015\/11\/Fujitsu-Lifebook-A514-Review.html\">first laptop from 2015<\/a> and the 120 GB Transcend SSD that I bought along with the laptop, both in their own enclosures. I might install Windows 10 on the 120GB SSD and use it to play games, and keep the 500 GB one for automated computer backups.<\/p>\n<p>I have 2TB + 200GB Google Drive storage, and 50GB iCloud storage for my online backup needs<\/p>\n<h3>Password manager &#8211; Bitwarden<\/h3>\n<p>I used LastPass for the longest time, but due to the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/22\/lastpass-customer-password-vaults-stolen\/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGu1deFAuRJN276qTfxkFFvxXrTo2VrABdcbDCpyV5ULaroA_mBBxZ816j8rcyjawlHwuCtMW__CzpB13WPXYRdFUCzwyXK1ZSXWsrh1PSMWmEapnxETooFP9vr_VjuI82RdSM-0S3b-lN2OdxPlHHBRIv6xb9HubAI1qK4JB2yK\">recent issues surrounding a security breach<\/a> they had, I&#8217;ve moved to Bitwarden and can recommend it.<\/p>\n<h3>Notes making &#8211; Obsidian<\/h3>\n<p>I highly recommend using Obsidian for making notes. I use it with the Excalidraw plugin and the integration is near perfect. With iCloud sync, everything works across all of my Apple devices seamlessly.<\/p>\n<h3>Todo list &#8211; TickTick<\/h3>\n<p>I love Ticktick for many reasons. The app is a joy to use and works across all of my devices. It has a global shortcut to quickly enter an item in the inbox. It works well coupled with the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Getting_Things_Done\">GTD method<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Misc<\/h3>\n<p>If you are looking for a nice watch, do give <a style=\"pointer-events: none;\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Casio_F-91W\">Casio F-91W<\/a> a thought.
