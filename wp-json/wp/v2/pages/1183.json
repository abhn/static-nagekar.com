It is because I am not a computer expert but computer enthusiast just like you. I will try to share whatever new I come to know. I would be extremely pleased to hear from you.<br \/>\nBy the way I am Abhishek Nagekar. You can meet me on Facebook(If you like to !!)<\/p>\n<footer>March 5, 2011<\/footer>\n<\/blockquote>\n<footer><\/footer>\n<footer><\/footer>\n<p>Fifteen year old me sure knew his priorities. This website, just like the one for which I wrote that intro, is to share whatever new I&#8217;m up to and meet interesting people. Most of it is just as true today as it was back then, except for the Facebook part. If you wish to get in touch, email is the way to go: <a href=\"mailto:hi@ab.hn\">hi@ab.hn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>These days, I&#8217;m employed at Mozilla to work on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/new\/\">Firefox.<\/a> It is something I <a href=\"https:\/\/nagekar.com\/2014\/11\/celebrating-10th-birthday-of-mozilla.html\">dreamed of doing<\/a> when I was younger.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m particularly fond of picking up silly little hobbies, learning just enough to be &#8220;good enough&#8221;, and then moving on. Some hobbies have stuck for long, like writing on this blog. Others have faded away having taught me something. I like the process of learning itself, going from knowing nothing about something to knowing something, which is why I don&#8217;t mind letting go of hobbies.<\/p>\n<p>Generally speaking, I am intentional about building skills and relationships over career, fame and money. I want to contribute my time towards building a world where we judge others based on how much meaning and happiness they spread, where borders don&#8217;t exist to keep the poor out and no human is considered illegal, where everyone can work on building and creating meaningfully without having to worry about food or shelter, and where we take care of the only place in the universe we call home, our planet.<\/p>\n<h3>Other pages of interest on this website<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/photography\">I&#8217;m a hobby photographer<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/setup\">My technical setup and debugging documentation<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/recommendations\">Books, movies and documentaries &#8211; Recommendations<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/quotes\">Curated quotes (from the internet, books and my friends)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Elsewhere on the internet<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/abhn\">Github where I post my open source work<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/abhn\/\">Linkedin because sometimes I need a job<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/abhn.github.io\/AbhiAtSadhu\/\">Check if I&#8217;m at Sadhu<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/horsebatterystaple\/\">Follow my worthy opponent phase on Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This website has been online for about a decade now.
