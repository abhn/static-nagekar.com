Meaning: When deciding whether to commit to something, if I feel anything less than \u201cWow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!\u201d\u2014then my answer is no. When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to really throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say, \u201cHELL YEAH!\u201d We\u2019re all busy. We\u2019ve all taken on too much.

They may be few in number but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing; the last of the human freedoms &#8211; to choose one&#8217;s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one&#8217;s own way &#8211; Viktor Frankl<\/li>\n<li>\u201cGeorge, you must realize that the world is a joke. There is no justice, everything is random. Only when you realize this will you understand how silly it is to take yourself seriously. There is no grand purpose in the universe. It just is. There\u2019s no particular meaning in what decision you make today about how to act.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>But today\u2019s society is characterized by achievement orientation, and consequently it adores people who are successful and happy and, in particular, it adores the young. It virtually ignores the value of all those who are otherwise, and in so doing blurs the decisive difference between being valuable in the sense of dignity and being valuable in the sense of usefulness. If one is not cognizant of this difference and holds that an individual\u2019s value stems only from his present usefulness, then, believe me, one owes it only to personal inconsistency not to plead for euthanasia along the lines of Hitler\u2019s program, that is to say, \u201cmercy\u201d killing of all those who have lost their social usefulness, be it because of old age, incurable illness, mental deterioration, or whatever handicap they may suffer.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cAs a professor in two fields, neurology and psychiatry, I am fully aware of the extent to which man is subject to biological, psychological and sociological conditions. But in addition to being a professor in two fields I am a survivor of four camps \u2014concentration camps, that is\u2014and as such I also bear witness to the unexpected extent to which man is capable of defying and braving even the worst conditions conceivable.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future which is in store for him? \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he will think. \u201cInstead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, though these are things which cannot inspire envy.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.<\/li>\n<li>Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked.<\/li>\n<li>To put the question (of meaning of life) in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: \u201cTell me, Master, what is the best move in the world?\u201d There simply is no such thing as the best or even a good move apart from a particular situation in a game and the particular personality of one\u2019s opponent.<\/li>\n<li>I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology, \u201chomeostasis,\u201d i.e., a tensionless state. What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him. What man needs is not homeostasis but what I call \u201cno\u00f6-dynamics,\u201d i.e., the existential dynamics in a polar field of tension where one pole is represented by a meaning that is to be fulfilled and the other pole by the man who has to fulfill it.<\/li>\n<li>From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two\u2014the \u201crace\u201d of the decent man and the \u201crace\u201d of the indecent man. Both are found everywhere; they penetrate into all groups of society. No group consists entirely of decent or indecent people. In this sense, no group is of \u201cpure race\u201d\u2014and therefore one occasionally found a decent fellow among the camp guards.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cWas Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben.\u201d (What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.)<\/li>\n<li>A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the \u201cwhy\u201d for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any \u201chow.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>The death rate in the week between Christmas, 1944, and New Year\u2019s, 1945, increased in camp beyond all previous experience. In his opinion, the explanation for this increase did not lie in the harder working conditions or the deterioration of our food supplies or a change of weather or new epidemics. It was simply that the majority of the prisoners had lived in the na\u00efve hope that they would be home again by Christmas. As the time drew near and there was no encouraging news, the prisoners lost courage and disappointment overcame them. This had a dangerous influence on their powers of resistance and a great number of them died.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cLife is like being at the dentist. You always think that the worst is still to come, and yet it is over already.\u201d Varying this, we could say that most men in a concentration camp believed that the real opportunities of life had passed. Yet, in reality, there was an opportunity and a challenge. One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge and simply vegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners.<\/li>\n<li>Otto, where are you now?

That meant that a person who had become a \u201cMoslem\u201d could not be taken straight to the gas chamber, but would have to wait until a so-called \u201csick convoy\u201d had been arranged to return to Auschwitz. This joyful surprise put us all in a good mood.<\/li>\n<li>A man\u2019s suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little.<\/li>\n<li>It is well known that humor, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cHow beautiful the world could be!\u201d<\/li>\n<li>One morning I heard someone, whom I knew to be brave and dignified, cry like a child because he finally had to go to the snowy marching grounds in his bare feet, as his shoes were too shrunken for him to wear. In those ghastly minutes, I found a little bit of comfort; a small piece of bread which I drew out of my pocket and munched with absorbed delight.<\/li>\n<li>Since I had always been especially sorry for people who suffered from fearful dreams or deliria, I wanted to wake the poor man. Suddenly I drew back the hand which was ready to shake him, frightened at the thing I was about to do. At that moment I became intensely conscious of the fact that no dream, no matter how horrible, could be as bad as the reality of the camp which surrounded us, and to which I was about to recall him.<\/li>\n<li>While my cold hands clasped a bowl of hot soup from which I sipped greedily, I happened to look out the window. The corpse which had just been removed stared in at me with glazed eyes. Two hours before I had spoken to that man. Now I continued sipping my soup.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cDon\u2019t aim at success\u2014the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one\u2019s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one\u2019s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run\u2014in the long run, I say!\u2014success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.

Many of us have an emotional reaction to a claim like that; it\u2019s not like a claim about the distance to Mars. Believing it or denying it is part of our identity; it says something about who we are, who our friends are, and the sort of world we want to live in. If I put a claim about climate change in a news headline, or in a graph designed to be shared on social media, it will attract attention and engagement not because it is true or false but because of the way people feel about it.<\/li>\n<li>the more persuasively we can make the case for what our friends already believe, the more our friends will respect us.<\/li>\n<li>Psychologists have a name for our tendency to confuse our own perspective with something more universal: it\u2019s called \u2018naive realism\u2019, the sense that we are seeing reality as it truly is, without filters or errors.<\/li>\n<li>Economists tend to cite their colleague Charles Goodhart, who wrote in 1975: \u2018Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.\u201912 (Or, more pithily: \u2018When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\u2019)<\/li>\n<li>Before we figure out whether nurses have had a pay rise, first find out what is meant by \u2018nurse\u2019.

Before concluding that inequality has soared, ask \u2018Inequality of what?\u2019 Demanding a short, sharp answer to the question \u2018Has inequality risen?\u2019 is not only unfair, but strangely incurious. If we are curious, instead, and ask the right questions, deeper insight is within easy reach.<\/li>\n<li>Consider the financial news. There is a big difference between the rolling business coverage of Bloomberg TV, the daily rhythm of the newspaper the Financial Times (my employer), and the weekly take of The Economist, even if the three outlets have a similar interest in business, economics and geopolitics.

As Loewenstein puts it, curiosity starts to glow when there\u2019s a gap \u2018between what we know and what we want to know\u2019. There\u2019s a sweet spot for curiosity: if we know nothing, we ask no questions; if we know everything, we ask no questions either. Curiosity is fuelled once we know enough to know that we do not know.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.<\/li>\n<li>How to Be Miserable in Your Twenties\n<ol>\n<li>Most of the harm done in the world is done by those who think they know what happiness is for other people and try to help them achieve it.<\/li>\n<li>There are few things more lonely than the end of a party when everyone has gone home but you.

So I&#8217;d go down the hall to the person who wrote it in the first place and start asking questions&#8230;and find out that I didn&#8217;t have the whole picture, the problem was messier than it first appeared, and there were perfectly valid reasons for the code being that way. This happened again and again. Sometimes I did find a real flaw, but even then it may have only occurred with data that wasn&#8217;t actually possible (because, for example, it was filtered by another part of the system).

I was moved by the imagery of this concept as it relates to my life and the creative process. Music takes me to places, and each song is a spirit island on which its soul lives infinitely. To release a song is both a death and a birth at the same time. The sounds contained in each song have reached the end of their life process. The once shape-shifting collage of expression has been crystallized into a final form, no longer kinetic. Yet it exists in a state of permanent potential energy, waiting to be accessed in the form of music, just as the memory of a departed soul will always have the power to move us. \u2013 Doug Appling (Emancipator)<\/li>\n<li>\u201cI urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, \u2018If this isn\u2019t nice, I don\u2019t know what is.&#8217;\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Remember to take care of people who take care of you.<\/li>\n<li>Everyone knows they\u2019re going to die,\u2019 he said again, \u2018but nobody believes it. If we did, we would do things differently.<\/li>\n<li>If you hold back on the emotions\u2013if you don\u2019t allow yourself to go all the way through them\u2013you can never get to being detached, you\u2019re too busy being afraid. You\u2019re afraid of the pain, you\u2019re afraid of the grief. You\u2019re afraid of the vulnerability that loving entails. But by throwing yourself into these emotions, by allowing yourself to dive in, all the way, over your head even, you experience them fully and completely.<\/li>\n<li>The truth is, part of me is every age. I\u2019m a three-year-old, I\u2019m a five-year-old, I\u2019m a thirty-seven-year-old, I\u2019m a fifty-year-old. I\u2019ve been through all of them, and I know what it\u2019s like. I delight in being a child when it\u2019s appropriate to be a child. I delight in being a wise old man when it\u2019s appropriate to be a wise old man. Think of all I can be! I am every age, up to my own.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>There\u2019s a big confusion in this country over what we want versus what we need,\u201d Morrie said. \u201cYou need food, you want a chocolate sundae. You have to be honest with yourself. You don\u2019t need the latest sports car, you don\u2019t need the biggest house. The truth is, you don\u2019t get satisfaction from those things. You know what really gives you satisfaction?\u2026 Offering others what you have to give\u2026I don\u2019t mean money, Mitch. I mean your time. Your concern. Your storytelling. It\u2019s not so hard.<\/li>\n<li>The one thing that can\u2019t be defeated is love, right?

So you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.<\/li>\n<li>To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cOnly once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you\u2019ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can\u2019t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it\u2019s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn\u2019t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day\u2019s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there\u2019s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you\u2019re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there\u2019s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that\u2019s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>The opposite of love is not hate, it&#8217;s indifference.

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 and \u2018Hang on!\u2019, can understand the jump.
